## 9.3 Events

While it's fun to style existing DOM elements, change text, and add new DOM elements, we're missing one important feature of most webpages: interactivity.

To make a web page interactive, we need it to respond to **events** ... things like a mouse being clicked or a key being pressed on the keyboard. There are a [dizzying array of events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) that JS can react to. Fortunately, we're going to be using a very small subset of them.

Figure 9.10 in the text shows the 4 steps involved with JS event processing:

1. define an **event handler** (developer does this)
2. **register** the event handler for a given event on a given element (developer does this)
3. **trigger** an event (user typically does this, though sometimes the page itself can)
4. execute the handler (the JS engine does this and the browser reacts)

Let's try out our job as developers - defining event handlers and registering them.

## 9.3.1 Implementing an Event Handler

Let's say that we have a button on our web page.  
Since users can click that button, we can write code that reacts to that click.  
How we react to it is up to us - but we now have the tools available to do a lot of neat things: style elements, or modify text, or even add/remove new elements on the page. The world is our oyster!

You might find it useful to open up VS Code and play along.
Here is the HTML you can use: https://floobits.com/jpratt-mru/lec-07/file/index.html
We'll create the associated `index.js` during the screencast.

**Notice that we've put the script tag just before `</body>` - this is to make sure that the DOM is available to us when we start playing with it. As mentioned before, though, we'll avoid using this method shortly.**

### using a named event handler

It can be easier when first starting out with event handlers to create them as function declarations.

Let's set things up so when our button is clicked, the h1 text turns red and becomes "Lo! The button was clicked, mightily."

```javascript
// step 1: define a named event handler
function changeThatH1() {
  const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
  h1.style.color = "red";
  h1.textContent = "Lo! The button was clicked, mightily.";
}

// step 2: register it to the click event on the button
// this is itself a 2-step dance:

// select the button
const btn = document.querySelector("button");

// tell it to "listen" for clicks (i.e. register a listener that reacts to clicks)
btn.addEventListener("click", changeThatH1); // pass in the NAME of the function

// alternatively, we don't really need to store the button element in a variable:
document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", changeThatH1); // this is pretty common - get used to it

// COMMON GOTCHA
btn.addEventListener("click", changeThatH1()); // don't invoke!
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] You can use a function declaration as an event handler. Just put code that performs the desired DOM zaniness in it.
  - [ ] If you were wondering - yes, you could just as easily use a function expression here as well.
- [ ] Register your hander with a specific element for a specific event using `addEventListener`.
- [ ] For click events, you use "click" as the first argument to `addEventListener`; the name of your handler is the second argument.
  - [ ] Yes, in JS you can pass in functions as arguments. They're just objects, right?
  - [ ] We call functions passed into other functions **callbacks**. You need to know this term.

## Cool devtool feature

Become aware of the **Event Listeners tab**. It may very well stop you from going insane. Or at least slow down the process.

### using an anonymous handler

Although using a named function as a handler is possible, it isn't used as often as the following technique: using an anonymous handler.

Let's just re-do the previous example, but this time with an anonymous handler.

```javascript
const btn = document.querySelector("button");
btn.addEventListener("click", function () {
  const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
  h1.style.color = "red";
  h1.textContent = "Lo! The button was clicked, mightily.";
});

// yup - we're done
// how's yer noggin?

// this form is also common
document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", function () {
  const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
  h1.style.color = "red";
  h1.textContent = "Lo! The button was clicked, mightily.";
});
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] Instead of naming the handler, you can just make it an anonymous function that winds up inside the `addEventListener` call as the second argument.
- [ ] This can feel - and look - pretty damn weird the first time you see it. But you have to get used to reading and writing things this way, because it's just the way things are usually done in JS land.

### using an anonymous handler, with arrow syntax

You'll see this form a lot as well.

```javascript
const btn = document.querySelector("button");
btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
  h1.style.color = "red";
  h1.textContent = "Lo! The button was clicked, mightily.";
});
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] You can use arrow syntax and transform your anonymous event handler from `function ()` to `() =>`. This is pretty common as well.
  - [ ] You can refer to 8.8.7 for a brief overview of arrow syntax, or look for some tutorials online aimed at beginners.
  - [ ] We'll only be using some basic forms of arrow syntax; you're not expected to become an expert at it!

### adding multiple listeners

One last example and we're done.

What if we want to add a handler to **multiple** DOM elements? Say, for example, we wanted every `<li>` that gets clicked to have some classes attached to it?

```javascript
// this WON'T WORK
document.querySelectorAll("li").addEventListener("click", function () {
  // some code
});

// do you understand why this is busted?

// instead, we must do this:
const lis = document.querySelectorAll("li");
for (let li of lis) {
  li.addEventListener("click", function () {
    li.classList.add("soimportant", "sobig"); // yeah, you can do this
  });
}
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] If you have multiple elements you'd like to react to an event, you need to register each one. Often, this will involve a loop.
