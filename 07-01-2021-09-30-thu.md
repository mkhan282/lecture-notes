## 9.2.1 Changing an Element's Style

A very common task is to change how things look on the page by altering the style of elements.

We do this in one of two ways.

### altering the style property of the element

Back to our Incognito window. It's trÃ¨s bland. Let's change that.

```javascript
// let's grab the h1. How?
const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");

h1.style.fontSize = "10em"; // embiggen!

// There's quite a bit going on here:
// - if we remember css, changing the font size requires the "font-size" css prop
// - we strip off the dash and camel case that sucker (fontSize)
// - we then change _that_ property in the style object, providing a valid string
// - LOOK CAREFULLY AT THE h1 TAG NOW

// what if we wanted to change the background color from black to blue?

let body = document.body; // yes, we could have used a selector method! learn, dammit!
body.style.backgroundColor = "blue";

body.style.fontFamily = "Arial Black";

// what if we want to apply some style to multiple things?
let allTheLists = document.querySelectorAll("li");
for (let li of allTheLists) {
  li.style.color = "yellow";
  li.style.padding = "30px";
}
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] We can change the style of any Element by changing that element's appropriate style property - this applies an **inline style**.
- [ ] You need to figure out the name of the CSS property you wish to change and then just strip it of dashes and camel case it.
- [ ] You can add multiple styles this way.
- [ ] If you want to style multiple things you've selected, you can iterate through those things and use this method.
