## What Should Be On My Radar?

- tut-04 (preview's been up for a few days)
- asg-1 milestone 2 (due next W)

---

## What's Today About?

If all goes according to plan (HA!), after today's lecture, we'll have talked about the last few pieces of the milestone 2 puzzle; in particular:

- the event object
- the dataset property

We'll also cover the important topics of event propagation and event delegation. (Delegation will be necessary for tut-04 and milestone 3...though you could add it to milestone 2 if you wish.)

## 9.3.3 The Event Object

So you get a "free" thing built for you whenever you use `addEventListener`: an **event object** that is stuffed full of information about that event you're listening to. Your event handler has access to it, though you often see/write handlers that don't care about it - tut-03's exercises were all that way, right?

Let's take a look at how you **can** access this cute little devil and what's inside it.

Here's a super-simple web page with a button and text field: https://floobits.com/jpratt-mru/lec-08/file/9.3.3/index.html

### DOMContentLoaded is an event

Let's see if we can dig a bit deeper into what's going on when the DOMContentLoaded event fires.

Code link: https://floobits.com/jpratt-mru/lec-08/file/9.3.3/index1.js
If you're following along, change the `<script>` src appropriately.

```javascript
let eventSnooper; // we're going to use this to spy on things

// we want to run snoopIt when the DOM Content is Loaded
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", snoopIt);

// Our event handler...but notice we have an odd parameter here - 'e'
function snoopIt(e) {
  eventSnooper = e; // an interesting hack to view in Console
  console.log(e); // this works, but...
  debugger; // ...this can be more useful
}

// thanks to our hack, we can access eventSnooper in the
// console - you should do that and hit . for autocompletion

// try eventSnooper.
// try eventSnooper.type
// try eventSnooper.target

// also, while we're here, take a look at the Scope section
// of the debugger - it's a lifesaver, folks
//   - take a look at your local variables
//   - take a look at your global variables (hmmm...snoopIt is there)
//   - take a look at `this`

// also, take a look at the Event Listeners tab!
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] Even though you see no sign of "e" when we call `addEventListener`, it's there - it gets passed to the event handler function (even if the event handler doesn't have any parameters).
- [ ] If you **do** want to use the generated event object in your event handler, just add a parameter to it. By convention, it's often named `e`.
- [ ] In this case, we were listening for `DOMContentLoaded` events, so the event object we get is a [PointerEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent) object.
  - [ ] the hierarchy we see here is **Event > Object**
- [ ] There's a lot of properties in there, eh? **target** and **type** can be especially useful.
- [ ] We can trigger the Chrome debugger in our code by using `debugger;` in our scripts. Tres useful, because we can get a better look at:
  - [ ] the scope of variables
  - [ ] object properties
  - [ ] what `this` currently is
- [ ] There is an Event Listener tab that can be useful as wells

### clicking stuff creates an event object

Now let's listen for a click event on the button and see what's different this time.

Code link: https://floobits.com/jpratt-mru/lec-08/file/9.3.3/index2.js
If you're following along, change the `<script>` src appropriately.

```javascript
let eventSnooper;

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", snoopIt);
});

function snoopIt(e) {
  eventSnooper = e;
  console.log(e);
  debugger;
}

// take a look at `this` now

// try eventSnooper.
// try eventSnooper.type
// try eventSnooper.target
// try eventSnooper.pointerType
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] In this case, we were listening for `click` events, so the event object we get is a [PointerEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent) object.
  - [ ] the hierarchy we see here is **PointerEvent > MouseEvent > UIEvent > Event > Object**
- [ ] Again, lots of properties.

### doing stuff in an input tag creates one, too

Now let's listen events that happen when someone's noodling around in an input tag.

Code link: https://floobits.com/jpratt-mru/lec-08/file/9.3.3/index3.js
If you're following along, change the `<script>` src appropriately.

```javascript
let eventSnooper;

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  document.querySelector("input").addEventListener("input", snoopIt);
});

function snoopIt(e) {
  eventSnooper = e;
  console.log(e);
  debugger;
}

// take a look at `this` now
// try doing a this.value...useful

// try eventSnooper.
// try eventSnooper.type
// try eventSnooper.target

// type a bit and inspect:
// try eventSnooper.data
// try eventSnooper.inputType

// delete a bit and inspect the same again
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] In this case, we were listening for `input` events, so the event object we get is a [KeyboardEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent) object.
  - [ ] the hierarchy we see here is **InputEvent > UIEvent > Event > Object**
- [ ] There's a lot of properties in there, eh? **data** is pretty useful.

### TIP

Most of the events you will deal with will involve Elements. You can find a list of the events Elements "get" by taking a look at the [MDN docs for Element events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element#events).

### ðŸ““ LET'S RECAP

- [ ] When you call `addEventListener`, the handler you provide is passed an **event object** that contains mucho info about the evento.
- [ ] Your handler doesn't **need** to use the event, but it _can_ if it wants by adding a parameter (that's often called `e` or `evt` or `event` by convention).
- [ ] Debugger good!

## 9.3.6 Using the Dataset Property

You can add your own custom attributes on HTML5 elements using `data attributes`. You can then both read and write those attribute's values via JavaScript. This can be super-useful. Like in assignment 1.

Here's some code we'll use for both this section of the text and next (9.3.4 Event Propagation): https://floobits.com/jpratt-mru/lec-08/file/9.3.6/index.html

The `index.js` makes some variables available in the console, so let's play there.

```javascript
h1.dataset; // we've got some kind of Map here...remember those from 2503?
h1.dataset.fuzziness; // give it a key, it gives you the associated value
h1.dataset.fuzziness = "nope"; // notice the change to the attribute value!
h1.dataset.fuzziness = "toss some spaces!"; // spaces are ok

div.dataset; // gotcha: notice how the key has gone from isValid => isvalid
div.dataset.isValid; // bang
div.dataset.isvalid; // there we go
let isValid = Boolean(div.dataset.isvalid);
typeof isValid;
isValid; // oh crap...JS, you dog
div.dataset.isvalid = true; // note how it's been turned into a string

p.dataset; // note how the key has been converted to numTimesOpened

p.dataset.fuzziness; // yes, you can have multiple
p.dataset.fuzziness = "wocka wocka"; // yes, independent
p.dataset.numTimesOpened; // it's a string
let times = p.dataset.numTimesOpened;
times += 1;
times; // whoops!
times = Number(p.dataset.numTimesOpened);
times += 1;
times; // there we go
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] HTML 5 has a data attribute you can use to make custom attributes in your HTML elements.
- [ ] You can use an elements `dataset` property to read and write to those attributes.
- [ ] This can be very useful when you want to store some vital piece of information in a tag itself. (For example, in the clickable image tags in assignment 1.)

## VS Code Tip Sidetrack

Make snippets for commonly used blobs of code you make. Like those dang `document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded")` or `document.querySelector("foo")` beasties.  
I'm trying out [Easy Snippet](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=inu1255.easy-snippet) at the moment.

## 9.3.4 Event Propagation

This is kind of neat. And weird. And awful. And useful. What more can we expect from the web? (BTW, this is NOT a JS oddity - this is TOTALLY on the web browser's guilt-plate.)

### the TL;DR

- events are constantly happening on a web page, even if you don't have any event handlers registered for them
- if an event handler **is** registered for an event, then (obviously) the element who registered that handler will react to it, buuuuut....
- ...every ancestor of that element will ALSO be given a chance to react to that event as well

### an example

I've got a web page + css:

- https://floobits.com/jpratt-mru/lec-08/file/9.3.4/index.html
- https://floobits.com/jpratt-mru/lec-08/file/9.3.4/style.css

We'll work on the JS side of things as we go:

- what behaviour do we notice when things are clicked? input is input?
- what is **e.target**? **e.currentTarget**?
- what does the debugger show?
  - what is in what scope?

### So do _all_ events bubble?

If you're looking at the MDN docs for an event, it'll show you there.

For example, here's the [good old click event's docs]. See the "Bubbles"?

Here's the [blur event's docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/blur_event). See the "Bubbles"?

### ðŸ““ LET'S RECAP

- [ ] Browsers are constantly firing events during a web page's "life". This is true even if no event handlers have been registered to react to those events.
- [ ] When an event happens for a particular element (the **target** of that event), if that element has registered an event handler for that event, the handler runs. But - and here's the kicker - an **event bubbling phase** happens: that event "bubbles" up through its ancestors, giving each of **them** to also react to that event, if they've also registered a handler for it.
- [ ] (There is also an **event capturing phase** that can happen that goes "outside in". You can read more about it in 9.3.4 and experience it first-hand with Lab exercise 9.7)
- [ ] Knowing about this behaviour is essential for dealing with otherwise-totally-wtf "bugs" in your page...but, more importantly, also essential to understand the next topic: **Event Delegation**

---

## 9.3.5 Event Delegation

You may be forgiven to be saying WTF?!?! about the whole bubbling thing.

It does have its uses, though.

### the idea

Since bubbling happens, we can move the responsibility of reacting to an event from the elements experiencing the event to their parents.

Every time a "kid" experiences an event, they let their parent know. You can visualize it like a bunch of kids corralled in a pen, with the parent watching over them. Whenever a kid experiences a certain event, they yell out "HEY! SOMEBODY CLICKED ME, MA!", or "HEY, MA! SOMEBODY WAS TYPING SOMETHING IN ME!" If Ma is interested in both that thing AND that kid, they can do something about it - otherwise, they just ignore it. Just like real parents.

This has some benefits:

1. each kid doesn't need to keep track of what to do when they're put in the pen; instead, they can get their Ma to do it instead
2. if a kid were to leave the pen, it's no biggie - we haven't lost any time teaching them anything
3. if a new kid enters the pen, we don't have to teach them anything new - kids already know how to yell about what's happening
4. if there's a TON of kids, you don't need to spend any resources teaching them nothin'
