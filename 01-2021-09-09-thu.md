# Lecture 01

**2021-09-09(R)**

Recording available here: xxx

**!!! Start Recording, JP !!!**

> This is kinda crazy-long, but hey - first day and all that.
>
> I plan on mostly talking about "plumbing" today...the little details that make up the course. I especially need to cover spec grading and Perks, since you likely haven't experienced them before. This is all in the course outline, but it'll be useful if you hear it "live" and have a chance to ask questions.
>
> We might have the time/energy to start some course material...but I doubt it.

## core principles - establishing a culture

- [ ] from [a video from a nice math guy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dabGwZGq9YqDbVEJbKrVm6xnl35NgYuw/view?usp=sharing)

1. "we all need time to think and learn" (everyone's wetwork is different...fast is not always "better")
2. "it's ok to make mistakes - that's the way we learn" (strive for growth, not "perfection" - whatever the hell THAT is)
3. "we can learn and do more when we're willing to risk" (screw Yoda - there **is** try. get out of your comfort zone)
4. "it's ok to ask for help - you don't have to do it all alone" (we can learn from each other - you AND me)

## communication with each other

- [ ] communication from **me** => **you**
  - [ ] I use BB Announcements. A lot. Like a ridiculous amount.
- [ ] communication from **you** => **me**
  - [ ] face-to-face in my office (masked for now)
  - [ ] email
  - [ ] live Meets via the Help System (course outline) ... going to be odd with live
  - [ ] <span style="color: red">Discord's a slippery slope (queue jumpin'), so please minimize</span>

## where to find course stuff

- [ ] BB is your one-stop shop
- [ ] much content (like course outline) will _live_ on GitHub but be linked on BB
  - [ ] changelogs or git commits
  - [ ] speaking of which - course outline (changes I can do and can't and promise)

## textbook & labs

- [ ] text pdf (check course outline)
  - [ ] if you have 2nd ed
- [ ] lab materials

## calendar call-out

- [ ] let's take a walk through the [Important Dates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JZEUX2ilHTnGeX9E403EFI8rXbQz9g2zCFakgh5vojk/edit#gid=20) - it's on BB
  - [ ] tutorials every Friday (more on them later)
  - [ ] assignment milestones approx every 2 weeks (more on them later)
  - [ ] National Day for Truth & Reconciliation
  - [ ] milestone 3 / midterm one-two (more on them later)
  - [ ] perk reset (more on them later)
  - [ ] Nov 12 I may be in Drumheller...but

## tutorials

- [ ] purpose
  - [ ] prompt recall
  - [ ] keep you on pace (falling behind bad)
  - [ ] gauge for me (are they keeping up? having trouble with some topics? do I need to intervene?)
  - [ ] gauge for you (am I "getting this"? do I know what I think I know? what topics do I need to work on?)
  - [ ] only way to get Perks
- [ ] what to expect
  - [ ] previews are on BB (skills covered, prereqs, advance prep suggestions)
  - [ ] 5 minutes prior your tut, link becomes available (pull down and bingo - instructions!)
    - [ ] usually 5 to 7 exercises
  - [ ] head over to Discord (maybe GatherTown?)
  - [ ] work alone or with others - your call - but I "test" individuals
  - [ ] 20 minute mark, I circulate randomly and see where you're at
    - [ ] are you Perk Eligible or on Perk Probation?
  - [ ] all exercises due by 9 or 10 (depends on section)
  - [ ] Eligible + all work done by deadline => Perk (they're coming)
- [ ] to be successful, you need to
  - [ ] check the previews
  - [ ] practice on your own (via labs and/or figure out how to improve on your own)

## assignments

- [ ] assignments are
  - [ ] big (dozens of hours of work)
  - [ ] portfolio-worthy
  - [ ] split into milestones
  - [ ] worth 50% of your mark

#### spec marking

- [ ] milestones have specifications ... basically a checklist
  - [ ] milestones 1 and 2 are bare minimums - feel free to be further ahead to avoid a punishing push to your third milestone
- [ ] must meet _all_ specs or it hurts
  - [ ] milestones 1 and 2: 100 / 50 / 0
  - [ ] milestones 3: B / C / D / F+ (A's are special)
- [ ] Machete don't pre-mark

#### pair(group) work

##### in defence of group work

- [ ] marking load
- [ ] pedagogy (learnification)
- [ ] companies want it

##### how it'll work for assignments

- [ ] milestone 1: on your own
- [ ] after submission deadline, into pairs (occasional 3s) you go
  - [ ] decided by completion rate and FIFO submission time (like with like)
- [ ] if splits happen
  - [ ] life happens (drop/add, irreconcilable differences)
- [ ] this'll be for both assignments, so good chance your second group will be different

## Perks

- [ ] basically a currency
- [ ] only way to earn them: timely tutorial submissions
- [ ] you spend them on:
  - [ ] 48 hour spec extensions
    - [ ] not all specs can be extended
    - [ ] multiple specs extendible, but
    - [ ] can't extend past 48 hours
  - [ ] midterm question re-dos
    - [ ] must meet me in person or on camera
    - [ ] won't just be a "this is the right answer" moment
- [ ] are Perks refundable? I don't know yet. Thoughts?
- [ ] Perk wipe on first tutorial after midterm

## so what do you do to keep up in this course?

I think you'll have the best chance of success if you:

- [ ] start on your first milestone now
- [ ] show up to lecture (or check out recordings) and do stuff when asked in the lecture
- [ ] ask questions when you don't understand something
  - [ ] in lecture, you can be anonymous - and you're likely not the only one with that question!
  - [ ] Discord can be very helpful (but no giving away answers)
  - [ ] I think I'm approachable...am I not approachable?!?
- [ ] do the labs steadily, using the tutorial preview suggestions as a guide
- [ ] accumulate as many Perks as you can by showing up for tutorials prepared
- [ ] do your best to finish the first milestone of each assignment on time - or even better, ahead of time - so you can be paired with someone with the same work ethic
- [ ] make sure you're comfortable with the tools (VS Code, Git) and procedures (getting GH assignments and submitting them) so you don't waste time doing that stuff
- [ ] accumulate skills in the tools so that when you _are_ coding, you're actually coding - and not fighting with your tools. Write tips down. Practice them repeatedly until they're in your muscle memory.

### JP's expectations

- [ ] you'll check BB daily
- [ ] you'll keep the pace
- [ ] you'll reach out if stuck (remember how?)
- [ ] you'll know where to look for stuff (where?)
- [ ] you'll keep track of due dates (where?)
- [ ] you'll take notes (but I'll give you what I have...where?)
- [ ] you'll help each other out...but don't steal opportunities from others...and play _fair_

### JP's commitments

- [ ] why should you have all the expectations?
- [ ] at the very least, I promise to:
  - [ ] do my best to teach in a challenging and engaging way
  - [ ] mark things in a timely fashion
  - [ ] be available for help a lot
  - [ ] work harder than I'm working you
