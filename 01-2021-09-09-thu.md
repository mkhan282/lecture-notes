# Lecture 01

**2021-09-09(R)**

Recording available here: https://youtu.be/-oA4BKasBFs

**!!! Start Recording, JP !!!**

> This is kinda crazy-long, but hey - first day and all that.
>
> I plan on mostly talking about "plumbing" today...the little details that make up the course. I especially need to cover spec grading and Perks, since you likely haven't experienced them before. This is all in the course outline, but it'll be useful if you hear it "live" and have a chance to ask questions.
>
> We might have the time/energy to start some course material...but I doubt it.

## core principles - establishing a culture

- [ ] from [a video from a nice math guy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dabGwZGq9YqDbVEJbKrVm6xnl35NgYuw/view?usp=sharing)

1. "we all need time to think and learn" (everyone's wetwork is different...fast is not always "better")
2. "it's ok to make mistakes - that's the way we learn" (strive for growth, not "perfection" - whatever the hell THAT is)
3. "we can learn and do more when we're willing to risk" (screw Yoda - there **is** try. get out of your comfort zone)
4. "it's ok to ask for help - you don't have to do it all alone" (we can learn from each other - you AND me)

## communication with each other

- [ ] communication from **me** => **you**
  - [ ] I use BB Announcements. A lot. Like a ridiculous amount.
- [ ] communication from **you** => **me**
  - [ ] face-to-face in my office (masked for now)
  - [ ] email
  - [ ] live Meets via the Help System (course outline) ... going to be odd with live
  - [ ] <span style="color: red">Discord's a slippery slope (queue jumpin'), so please minimize</span>

## where to find course stuff

- [ ] BB is your one-stop shop
- [ ] much content (like course outline) will _live_ on GitHub but be linked on BB
  - [ ] changelogs or git commits
  - [ ] speaking of which - course outline (changes I can do and can't and promise)

## textbook & labs

- [ ] text pdf (check course outline)
  - [ ] if you have 2nd ed
- [ ] lab materials

## calendar call-out

- [ ] let's take a walk through the [Important Dates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JZEUX2ilHTnGeX9E403EFI8rXbQz9g2zCFakgh5vojk/edit#gid=20) - it's on BB
  - [ ] tutorials every Friday (more on them later)
  - [ ] assignment milestones approx every 2 weeks (more on them later)
  - [ ] National Day for Truth & Reconciliation
  - [ ] milestone 3 / midterm one-two (more on them later)
  - [ ] perk reset (more on them later)
  - [ ] Nov 12 I may be in Drumheller...but

## tutorials

- [ ] purpose
  - [ ] prompt recall
  - [ ] keep you on pace (falling behind bad)
  - [ ] gauge for me (are they keeping up? having trouble with some topics? do I need to intervene?)
  - [ ] gauge for you (am I "getting this"? do I know what I think I know? what topics do I need to work on?)
  - [ ] only way to get Perks
- [ ] what to expect
  - [ ] previews are on BB (skills covered, prereqs, advance prep suggestions)
  - [ ] 5 minutes prior your tut, link becomes available (pull down and bingo - instructions!)
    - [ ] usually 5 to 7 exercises
  - [ ] head over to Discord (maybe GatherTown?)
  - [ ] work alone or with others - your call - but I "test" individuals
  - [ ] 20 minute mark, I circulate randomly and see where you're at
    - [ ] are you Perk Eligible or on Perk Probation?
  - [ ] all exercises due by 9 or 10 (depends on section)
  - [ ] Eligible + all work done by deadline => Perk (they're coming)
- [ ] to be successful, you need to
  - [ ] check the previews
  - [ ] practice on your own (via labs and/or figure out how to improve on your own)

## assignments

- [ ] assignments are
  - [ ] big (dozens of hours of work)
  - [ ] portfolio-worthy
  - [ ] split into milestones
  - [ ] worth 50% of your mark

#### spec marking

- [ ] milestones have specifications ... basically a checklist
  - [ ] milestones 1 and 2 are bare minimums - feel free to be further ahead to avoid a punishing push to your third milestone
- [ ] must meet _all_ specs or it hurts
  - [ ] milestones 1 and 2: 100 / 50 / 0
  - [ ] milestones 3: B / C / D / F+ (A's are special)
- [ ] Machete don't pre-mark

#### pair(group) work

##### in defence of group work

- [ ] marking load
- [ ] pedagogy (learnification)
- [ ] companies want it

##### how it'll work for assignments

- [ ] milestone 1: on your own
- [ ] after submission deadline, into pairs (occasional 3s) you go
  - [ ] decided by completion rate and FIFO submission time (like with like)
- [ ] if splits happen
  - [ ] life happens (drop/add, irreconcilable differences)
- [ ] this'll be for both assignments, so good chance your second group will be different

## Perks

- [ ] basically a currency
- [ ] only way to earn them: timely tutorial submissions
- [ ] you spend them on:
  - [ ] 48 hour spec extensions
    - [ ] not all specs can be extended
    - [ ] multiple specs extendible, but
    - [ ] can't extend past 48 hours
  - [ ] midterm question re-dos
    - [ ] must meet me in person or on camera
    - [ ] won't just be a "this is the right answer" moment
- [ ] are Perks refundable? I don't know yet. Thoughts?
- [ ] Perk wipe on first tutorial after midterm

## so what do you do to keep up in this course?

I think you'll have the best chance of success if you:

- [ ] start on your first milestone now
- [ ] show up to lecture (or check out recordings) and do stuff when asked in the lecture
- [ ] ask questions when you don't understand something
  - [ ] in lecture, you can be anonymous - and you're likely not the only one with that question!
  - [ ] Discord can be very helpful (but no giving away answers)
  - [ ] I think I'm approachable...am I not approachable?!?
- [ ] do the labs steadily, using the tutorial preview suggestions as a guide
- [ ] accumulate as many Perks as you can by showing up for tutorials prepared
- [ ] do your best to finish the first milestone of each assignment on time - or even better, ahead of time - so you can be paired with someone with the same work ethic
- [ ] make sure you're comfortable with the tools (VS Code, Git) and procedures (getting GH assignments and submitting them) so you don't waste time doing that stuff
- [ ] accumulate skills in the tools so that when you _are_ coding, you're actually coding - and not fighting with your tools. Write tips down. Practice them repeatedly until they're in your muscle memory.

### JP's expectations

- [ ] you'll check BB daily
- [ ] you'll keep the pace
- [ ] you'll reach out if stuck (remember how?)
- [ ] you'll know where to look for stuff (where?)
- [ ] you'll keep track of due dates (where?)
- [ ] you'll take notes (but I'll give you what I have...where?)
- [ ] you'll help each other out...but don't steal opportunities from others...and play _fair_

### JP's commitments

- [ ] why should you have all the expectations?
- [ ] at the very least, I promise to:
  - [ ] do my best to teach in a challenging and engaging way
  - [ ] mark things in a timely fashion
  - [ ] be available for help a lot
  - [ ] work harder than I'm working you

**HERE ENDETH THE LESSON**

## questions from y'all during the lecture

### anonymous qs

- **Why can't we get a physical copy of the textbook?**
  - Publisher's decision, I'm afraid. May change in the future, but I have no further insight to provide.
- **Will the second edition (textbook) be good to use?**
  - Kind of. Chapters 8 and 9 in the 3ed are heavily changed and are a large part of this course. Randy says if you show me a physical copy (in person or over webcam), I can give you pdfs of these chapters. No sharing, please.
- **Why is the lab not open, or yet?**
  - Most people should be able to get in now (2021-09-13). If you're still having trouble, go on down to Security and say you're supposed to be able to get into lab X, but your card won't let you.
- **Favorite anime?**
  - Movie? Almost anything by Studio Ghibli. Series? Back in Japan (circa 1993) I was a big fan of Ghost Sweeper Mikami. These days, I've very much enjoyed Jujutsu Kaisen and My Hero Academia.
- **How did you find out about Gather Town for the labs?**
  - My wife. If you're taking Japanese or Japanese Culture here at MRU, she's your instructor.
- **What would you say is good enough for css and html (just so we are confident with it)?**
  - Tough question. Anything you learned in Web 1 is technically fair game. For the assignments, it'll be very useful if your grid and flexbox skills are ok. You don't have to be a wizard.
- **Is group work gonna be randomized?**
  - Somewhat. I will group people by how much of milestone 1 they've completed and then by order of submission of milestone 1. The idea is that you're more likely to be paired with someone with the same work ethic that way.
- **Any cool group projects this year?**
  - Both assignments are group projects. I'd say they're pretty cool - they're both Randy's babies, though. So not the usual JP madness.
- **Will labs be recorded? or have their answers posted afterwards?**
  - Tuts aren't going to be "JP delivers content during tutorial and then you do stuff" style. They're "JP gives you some exercises to see if you're keeping up with course material and then checks your work partway through the tut". So no recordings.
- **Will jQuery be covered in this course?**
  - Nope. Look in the textbook's index for jQuery and read - there's some explanation in there as to why it won't be covered.
- **Could you briefly explain the perks system?**
  - Done during lecture and it's in the course outline.
- **Do we have a weekly drill submission?**
  - Kind of. They're lab exercises. Much shorter than my usual drills. Honest.
- **Is there a Discord for this class?**
  - Yup. https://discord.com/invite/bPRyXsJ6fa
- **Are assignments worth 25% or 30%? I saw on the blackboard it was 30% but on course outline it was 25%?**
  - Yah - I was going to make them 30, but switched 'em to 25 ... now everything is just 25. Seemed simpler.
- **Is your pc gonna be okay with that many tabs?**
  - So far so good. I think. Is my computer supposed to be making these soft whimpering sounds?
- **When will we get the gihub classroom link?**
  - Links for asg-01 and tut-00 were up. Further tut links will come out 5 minutes before your tutorial starts. They'll be up on the **tutorial** Blackboard site. I might change this to just emailing folks 5 minutes prior to the tut, but that might be a bit bleah for me.
- **Can we choose the ppl we want to work with or nah?**
  - Nah. See the "Is group work gonna pe randomized?" q above.
- **So we can't choose our partner?**
  - See above.
- **Is assignment 2 the group assignment?**
  - Both assignments are group assignments, though for both you get to milestone 1 on your own and then get paired up.
- **Is it possible to work alone?**
  - Probably not. While I'm more comfortable coding by myself, too, the benefits of working together were talked about in lecture. If you _really_ think you have a compelling reason, please talk to me in private.
- **Will it be same partner for assignment 2 or different?**
  - Likely different. The grouping mechanism is the same as for asg-01.
- **Are the groups swapped often? Or is it just you get a group forever?**
  - For a given assignment? No swapping unless sh\*t goes south.
- **Do perks get reset or does it keep going up if you receive them?**
  - The Great Perk Reset happens after the midterm and first assignment have been submitted.
- **What is the max amount of perks we can receive?**
  - 12
- **How much time after the midterm can we use the perk? Is it right after or after a specific amount of time?**
  - Check the course outline.
- **You can use as many perks as you want on the midterm?**
  - Well, as many Perks as you _have_. :)
- **Is the midterm open book?**
  - Open book, closed human communication, yes.
- **If at the end of the semester you didn't use any perks or have perks remaining what can you do with them?**
  - Unneeded Perks to me are a strong motivator for me to move people up a grade band, especially if they're on the edge of a bump.
- **Where can we view how many perks we have?**
  - Check your grades in our BB site.
- **Can you give your perks to someone else?**
  - Donations won't be allowed (and this policy is now in the course outline).
- **Why are you resetting our perks after the midterm?**
  - Main reason: to discourage - or, more accurately, prevent - folks from coasting in the second half of the course.
- **Is Github the best \"hub\" of all time?**
  - Depends on your Hub Criteria.
- **If your partner has 0 perk and u have 2 perks, can u spend your 2 perks for 1 checkbox extension in an assignment for your group?**
  - Negative. One Perk for each person in the group.
- **Hey JP sorry for looking at your tabs but what is the 90 day challenge about?**
  - That's the [Mark Lauren 90-Day Challenge](https://marklauren.com/workout-routines/90-day-challenge/). I was pretty into it for a good year or so during the pandemic...happy to be back at the MRU gym now, though. Plus the Challenge is pretty rough on my old-man shoulders (I have bursitis in both, so yay).

### Meet qs

- **Is physical copy (of text) required for this course or will have information that is needed for the exams that the lectures won't provide?**
  - Lectures and tutorials will follow the textbook topics and pace. You can find this info through other channels, so following along in lecture and looking around online could be a thing you do. Sounds like extra work, but it's your time. I won't ask any questions specific to something said in the text.
- **Will the e-book disappear after some time?**
  - I just looked now (2021-09-12). The page says "12-month access eText" ... hrmph. I thought they'd at least give you a PDF that was yours. I'm not happy with this, but it's currently what it is. I _will_ talk to Randy about it, though it's unlikely he has any influence over Pearson.
- **48h extension on a midterm question?**
  - Likely a bit longer - check out the course outline's "Perks for midterm question do-overs" section.

## suggestions for success

So what's upcoming in the near future?

- tut-01 on Friday, Sept 17
- the asg-01 milestone 1 submission on Wednesday, Sept 22

Based on these, if I were taking this course, I'd work to:

- make sure I'm super-comfortable cloning a tutorial onto my machine. Ideally, I wanna do that without having to think too much or fumble around...the second the GitHub Classroom link goes live, I wanna have the repo on my machine and start reading the instructions within 60 seconds. If I wasn't at that point, I'd practice until I _was_ at that point.

- read the [preview for tut-01](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-3512-202104-001/tutorial-previews/blob/main/tut-01.md), make sure I've done its prerequisites (especially the suggested lab exercises), and make sure I feel comfortable with all the skills mentioned.

- be well into the suggestions mentioned in the "assignment nudge" announcement on Blackboard made on September 12.
