## 9.2.2 InnerHTML vs textContent vs DOM Manipulation

So we can make Elements _look_ a certain way by styling them, either inline or via attaching classes to them.

But, man...there's a LOT of text on web pages, eh? How do we change _that_?

Let's pop open an Incognito window again and futz in there.

### the innerHTML property

```javascript
// let's change the h1 text
const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");

h1.innerHTML; // inspect that sucker...no surprises _here_ (ominous)

// innerHTML is writeable!

h1.innerHTML = "You've gone Ninja"; // that's neat. The feeling of POWAAAAH!

// unfortunately, life can be complicated

// what if we grab something that has children?
const firstList = document
  .querySelector("#bulletpoints-wrapper")
  .querySelector("ul");

// Two things:`
//   1) if this kind of formatting looks weird, get used to it - it's pretty
//      common Out There
//   2) yes, we could have chosen a different CSS selector - just wanted to
//      practice that chaining thing

const innerHTMLInThatThing = firstList.innerHTML; // inspect it

// notice it includes all the whitespace (including newlines) and all
// the markup that's nested in the ul as well (that's why it's called)
// INNER HTML, I reckon!

firstList.innerHTML =
  "<li>Your children's blood type.</li>" +
  "<li>Your shoe size.</li>" +
  "<li>The name of that thing standing right behind you.</li>";

// could also use a loop...
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  firstList.innerHTML += `<li>item${i}</li>`;
}
// ...but that's not a great idea, because writing to the DOM is quite a bit
//  more costly than just reading from it

// Also, this kind of badness can happen
document.body.innerHTML = `<form onsubmit='alert("HAXXORd");'>
  <label for="ccard">Credit Card Num?</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="ccard" name="ccard"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>`;
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] The `innerHTML` property lets you read and write text "inside" the tags associated with the Element.
- [ ] If used to read, you'll get back _everything_ between the tags of the involved Element - whitespace and markup.
- [ ] If used to write, you can just write some text...or even introduce new markup into the document...markup that is now available in the DOM for use.

To be honest, I (and the text) suggest you avoid using innerHTML. It's a bit too easy to accidentally write malformed markup - not to mention the potential security issues that occur when innerHTML is used (like a user putting a `<script>` block of some sort into a form input somewhere which winds up being added to the DOM).

If you want to just add some text, using textContent (covered next).  
If you want to actually add some HTML elements to the DOM, we'll cover that in the next screencast.

### the textContent property

If we just want to access (or change) text within various tags, we can use the `textContent` property.

```javascript
// let's grab the stuff we grabbed before and see if we can see a difference
const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
h1.textContent; // no change here!

h1.textContent = "You've gone off the rails."; // also writeable

const firstList = document.querySelector("#bulletpoints-wrapper ul");
const textInThatThing = firstList.textContent; // inspect

// Interesting...what's different this time?

// I wonder if we can be naughty here?
document.body.textContent = `<form onsubmit='alert("HAXXORd");'>
  <label for="ccard">Credit Card Num?</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="ccard" name="ccard"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>`;
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] The `innerHTML` property lets you read and write text "inside" the tags associated with the Element.
- [ ] If used to read, you _won't_ get back any markup - it's stripped. But you will get whitespace.
- [ ] If used to write, any markup will be escaped.

So use textContent for accessing and changing text.

### DOM manipulation

What if we actually want to introduce **new** DOM elements onto the page? Or remove ones are there?

We'll this in the next screencast! See you there!
