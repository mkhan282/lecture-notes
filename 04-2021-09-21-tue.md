## odds & ends

- [ ] [quick poll, please](https://www.directpoll.com/r?XDbzPBd3ixYqg8aM6HAAxEFkbD3iEPxTGiMZyeyf)
  - [ ] https://directpoll.com/c?XDVhEt8pRcbhnr5feG0ZmAVwb3WoQhG
- [ ] I was pretty flexible with "doneness"...that flexibility will be decreasing....
- [ ] clarity around next Thursday
- [ ] still finding my lecture groove. I've had a mini-epiphany
  - [ ] leave "easy for for person w/ Java exp" stuff
  - [ ] focus on JS new stuff
  - [ ] mention JS weird stuff...but don't dive too deep (leave that for you if you wanna be 'that JS dev')
- [ ] 2 external resource suggestions:
  - [ ] [Execute Program's](https://www.executeprogram.com/) JavaScript Arrays course. We're covering some array stuff today - this course is very hands-on, with super-brief lessons. Highly recommended, but will likely use a few things (functions, anonymous functions, arrow notation) that we won't talk about until Thursday.
  - [ ] Frontend Masters courses; you get 6 months of free access via the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). Stellar stuff, but leans heavily toward intermediate/advanced developers.

## what's ahead?

- tut-02 on Friday, Sept 24
- asg-01 milestone 1 submission tomorrow @ 9PM
  - how I'm going to mark
    - go to your repo
    - look for the LAST branch with the word "submit" it in <span style="color: red; font-size: 1.3em;">that's on time</span>
    - go to the URL you provided, prepended with "submitxx--"
  - will start marking Thursday early morning; plan is to have you in groups before the end of that day so you can get working

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; font-size: 2em;">We have a lot of ground to cover today. Get in the zone, peeps.</span>

## a brief recap

- JS can go inline (don't do it), embedded (don't do it unless told to), or external (preferred; usually in `<head>`)
- prefer `let` over `var`
- `const` only means the value in that constant's "memory slot" can't change
  - primitives can't be altered (try it)
  - array contents **can** be modified
  - objects (later today) **can** be altered

> _Unless your workplace dictates it for you, you get to choose where you want to sit on the const fence: the "whenever you can" camp, or the "only when you mean it" camp. I'm honestly fine either way. Life's too short._

- we can create popups by calling `alert` and `prompt` - Web API methods
- we can log/warn/error/info to console (not JS - just a convenience to devs provided by environment)
- we can write to an HTML doc with `document.write`, though normally shouldn't
- primitive types most commonly encountered are `boolean`, `number`, `string`, and `undefined`.
- everything not-primitive is a reference type (object)
- just like Java, there are some "built-in" objects that you encounter a lot - and which have useful methods
  - suggest getting familiar at first with `Number` and `String`
  - use MDN docs to find out their methods and usage...and to discover other "built-ins"
- concatenation can be done with `+` (like in Java) or with `template literals` (which are kinda like `format` and `printf` in Java...kinda - I like JS-style better)
- conditionals are pretty much like Java:
  - `if`, `else if`, and `else`
  - `switch`
  - `conditional/ternary operator` (quite common in JS...you should know it on sight, even if you don't use it yourself. (you should use it yourself :) )

## 8.4 Conditionals

- the comparator operators you are used to from Java are all in JS:
  - ==, !=
  - <, <=
  - \>, >=
- but we have these weirdos as well:

  - ===
  - !==

- what's the difference between ==/=== (and !=/!==)? anyone?

  > note we do NOT have these available:
  >
  > - <==, >==
  > - some interesting discussions out there as to why can be found

- _why_ have them? anyone?

- if you don't use them, what kind of things can we do?
  - 3 == "3"
  - 45 == 45.00
  - 1 == true
  - "" == false

What is going on here?

## coercion

Though some people might quibble, we can consider **type coercion** (or just **coercion**) basically the same as type **casting**, which you've seen in Java sometimes. Remember stuff like this?

```java

// explicit coercion/casting
int someInt = (int)400.20;

// or

// implicit coercion/casting
ArrayList<Integer> someNums = new ArrayList<>();
sumeNums.add(3);
```

JavaScript does the second kind - implicit coercion - a lot.

- this coercion is a well-known (maybe **the** most well-known) part of JS' quirkiness. See the [WAT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3se2-thqf-A)
- so to not be surprised, you would have to have a good understanding of the coercion process. This is a quite a bit of work.
  - it's _necessary_ work if you want to be a JS wizard...but that's not the goal of this course. If you want to be a wizard, I'd look into anything done by Kyle Simpson. Dude knows his JS.

It's easy to rag on JS for some of its decisions, like coercion.
Keep in mind, these decisions were made in a certain point in history.
A lot of webwork is with text, right? It kinda makes sense to make a language that provides developers with some flexibility - to play a little loose with things. Of course, this has repercussions:

- if you don't understand what's going on, you can be confused by a lot of "buggy" behaviour
- if you're just learning the language and you're not at least _aware_ of what's going on, you'll probably create incorrect mental models which is going to make your work with the language very confusing...and models can be hard to "shake"

#### BTW - many of you took advantage (probably unknowingly) of this quirkiness in tut-01

Here's an example of some code where folks were getting correct behaviour...but just because they were "lucky".

**tut-01 ex 06:**

```javascript
const conversion = 5;

let userInput = prompt("How many teaspoons?");

document.write(
  `<h1>There are ${conversion * userInput}mL in ${userInput} teaspoons.</h1>`
);
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] Where's the coercion happening?
- [ ] What happens if this had been `conversion + userInput`?
- [ ] How can you make the _implicit_ conversion _explicit_?

#### So what should YOU do about this confusing beast?

Honestly? That depends on how far you want to go in the language at the moment. If you plan on moving past the beginner level, you need to take the time to learn how things work - you've got to pop the hood.

> If you want to dive deeper into this, you can check out [Deep JavaScript Foundations by Kyle Simpson](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/deep-javascript-v3) on Frontend Masters.

If you just want to get through the course (anting to do this does not make you a bad person, by the way), you can get away with skipping the deep learning dive and just take some precautions that should reduce the chance of you falling for the more common pitfalls.

- use strict comparisons by default
- use tools like ESLint to keep you honest
- use `use strict` to do the same

## 8.4.1 Truthy and Falsy

This is very much NOT like Java, so let's talk about it.

In Java, if you have a condition in an if/else-if or loop, it has to explicitly evaluate to a boolean:

```java
while (!list.empty()) // empty() returns a boolean

// or

if (tax > 12 && service.equals("OK")) // each part of this tests is an explicit boolean value

```

In Javascript, thanks to - you guessed it - coercion, **anything** is turned into a boolean value when tossed into a condition!

In JS, everything is either `truthy` or `falsy`.

Fortunately, there are only 7 things that evaluate to falsy:

1. false (well, duh)
2. the empty string ("", '', and ``)
3. 0 (and -0 and 0n)
4. NaN
5. null
6. undefined
7. document.all (just forget this one - it's super-esoteric)

These actually all kinda make sense, except for the last one, so it's not too hard to remember them.

Avoid doing (blah === true) or (blah == false) and the like - it's considered a bit gauche.

You should know this stuff, because it's common in "real life" JS code. (And it's test-fodder, too.)

## 8.5 Loops

We won't spend any time here...the loops you know and love(?) from Java are here and behave as you'd expect:

- while
- do...while
- for

The for-each loop in Java is here as well, but it's called `for-of` (do NOT use the `for-in`! careful!). We'll see that in action when we talk about arrays soon.

And by "soon", I mean "now".

## 8.6 Arrays (imporant)

### defining an array

#### Java

With Java, we need to provide a type (why?) as well as a size (either explicitly or implicitly):

```java
int[] arrOfInts = new int[10]; // what does arrOfInts hold?

int[] arrayWithSomeNums = {1, 2, 3}; // how about this?

String[] arrOfStrings = new String[3]; // how about this?

String[] arrayWithHmmm = {}; // what about this? is this useful at all?!?!

```

#### JS

With JS, we don't need either! But you have to be a bit careful, because JS has some quirks. (surprised?)

```javascript
// we can make an empty array very easily...
let foo = [];

// ...and unlike it's Java counterpart, it's very useful! :)
foo[0] = "huzzay!"; // what's in foo now?

// we can also do things this way
let bar = new Array(6); // what do you suppose is in this array?

let qux = new Array("my", "dog", "has", "fleas"); // this one?

let baz = new Array(6, 2); // and this one?

// this behaviour is...unexpected. You might wanna avoid using Array().
```

### batteries included

Like Java's arrays, you get `length`:

```javascript
let arr = [];
console.log(arr.length); // 0

const yarr = ["I", "am", "a", "pirate!"];
console.log(arr.length); // 4. No surprises here, folks.
```

Unlike Java's arrays, JS's arrays come with a bunch of useful methods built-in.
(Kind of like Java's ArrayList.)

Unfortunately, we're not going to get to a lot of the super-duper-useful ones until we hit chapter 10 (after Reading Week)...but there are still some nice ones available for the time being:

```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

arr.push(4);
array.pop();

// if you find these next 2 hard to remember, get in line
arr.shift();
arr.unshift(12);
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- What did push(4) do? What does it return? Why "push"?
- What did pop() do? What does it return? Why "pop"?
- What did shift() do? What does it return?
- What did unshift(12) do? What does it return?
- Are you surprised these work on a const array?

> _There are more. Read and play 'round! As always, MDN is your friend._

Because arrays are the collection of choice in JS, you will likely use them a bunch. Getting to know the JS array API is time _definitely_ well-spent. The Execute Code site can help a lot here.

### spread syntax (very useful!)

There's something called **spread syntax** that is used in a variety of ways in JS. It's very useful in all its forms.

Let's just talk about how it's used with array literals for now.

```javascript
let arr = ["let", "the", "games"];
let arr2 = [...arr];

arr2.push("begin");

arr; // what's here?
arr2; // and here?

let nesty = ["let", ["the", "games"]];
let nesty2 = [...nesty];

nesty2;

nesty[1].push("begin");

nesty;
nesty2; // uh-oes
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- What did `[...arr]` do?
- Does `...arr` change arr?
- What's going on with the line with the `push()`?
- What's in nesty2 after the push? Why?
  - What does this tell you about the kind of copying going on?
  - What did we call this kind of copy in 1502/2503?

### 8.6.1 iterating through arrays (important)

If you've taken a course with me, you know I have a significant bromantic feelings for Java's for-each loop:

```java
String[] stuffs = {"I", "love", "for-each"};

// plain old for loop - so noisy!
for (int i = 0; i < stuffs.length; i++) {
  System.out.println(stuffs[i]);
}

// the sweet for-each alternative
for (String s : stuffs) {
  System.out.println(s);
}
```

The magic lives on in JS's for-each loop:

```javascript
const stuffs = ["I", "love", "for-of"];

// yes, you *can* do this...
for (let i = 0; i < stuffs.length; i++) {
  console.log(stuffs[i]);
}

// ...but why? This is soooo much better:
for (const s of stuffs) {
  console.log(s);
}

// BEWARE!
for (const s in stuffs) {
  console.log(s);
}
```

### 8.6.2 destructuring (sometimes useful)

This is a "nice-to-have" feature - it's not "necessary", so you can look into it later if you're interested.

# DETOUR: OH YOU KOOKY JS

Some things about JS arrays can be surprising.

Of course, NOTHING is as it seems in JS land...

```javascript
let foo = [];
foo[5] = "hmmmm"; // what's in foo now? THIS IS VERY SURPRISING

foo[-1] = "he he he"; // say what now?

typeof foo; // aroo?
```

A lot of the confusing behaviour of JS arrays becomes slightly less confusing when you realize that JS arrays are actually just **objects** and not the structures you might be used to in Java (or C or C++).

---

## 8.7 Objects

I'd like you to set aside your current mental models about objects - those models have likely been built from your work in Java and can cause confusion when talking about JS objects.

So - fresh start.

### 8.7.1 creating objects using object literal notation

Here's some code that creates a 3 new JS objects using **object literal notation**:

```javascript
let aCuteKitten = {
  name: "Mr. Fluffles",
  ageInWeeks: 3,
  isVaccinated: true,
};

const anAdorablePuppy = {
  name: "Wanita", // this is a bit of a Japanese-related joke. a poor one
  "favorite snacky-snack": { brand: "Hungry Dog", price: 12.43 },
  vaccinationDates: [new Date(1995, 11, 17), new Date(1996, 1, 3)],
};

let nuttinAtAll = {};
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] What symbols do we use to denote an object?
- [ ] What **properties** do these objects have?
- [ ] What **keys** do these objects have?
- [ ] What types of **property values** do you see?
- [ ] What symbol do we use to separate keys from their values?
- [ ] What symbol do we use to separate properties?
  - [ ] Do you see anything odd about the use of that symbol?
- [ ] Why is "favorite snacky-snack" in quotes, but the other keys aren't?
- [ ] What is `nuttinAtAll`?
- [ ] Can you put comments inside an object literal?
- [ ] What's up with the `[[Prototype]]` stuff shown in the console?

<div style="border: 5px solid blue; border-radius: 10px; padding: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Being comfortable with reading and writing object literal notation is essential, both for the course and for any real-life work you intend to do with JS.</div>

---

#### getting property values

If all we could do is _make_ objects, it wouldn't be very useful. We usually want to get the values of properties from objects.

How do we do that?

```javascript
// let's keep using the objects from before

console.log("aCuteKitten's name:", aCuteKitten.name);
console.log("is that kitten vaccinated, m'am?", aCuteKitten["isVaccinated"]);

console.log("pro-vax puppy!", anAdorablePuppy.vaccinationDates);
console.log(anAdorablePuppy."favorite snacky-snack"); // really?
console.log(anAdorablePuppy[favorite snacky-snack]); // REALLY?!?
console.log(anAdorablePuppy['favorite snacky-snack']); // there we go!

const snackKey = "favorite snacky-snack";
console.log(anAdorablePuppy.snackKey); // sad again
console.log(anAdorablePuppy[snackKey]); // happy again


console.log(nuttinAtAll.glorp); // this seems doomed to fail....
console.log(nuttinAtAll.toString()); // huh
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] What two ways do we have of getting the value in a property?
- [ ] One of the notations **must** be used under certain conditions. What notation is that and what conditions force you to use it?
- [ ] What happens when you access a key that's not in the object?
- [ ] What's up with the `toString()` call on the "empty" object?

---

#### setting property values

Chances are, you'll also want to change the property values of objects, too.

How do we do that?

```javascript
// let's keep using the objects from before
// examine each one in the console after each change is made

aCuteKitten.name = "Flufftar, Destroyer of Couches";

anAdorablePuppy["favorite snacky-snack"] = {
  brand: "All the Bits",
  price: 4.17,
};

let aKey = "vaccination" + "Dates";

anAdorablePuppy[aKey].push(new Date(1997, 2, 3));

nuttinAtAll.glorp = `ze date: ${anAdorablePuppy.vaccinationDates[1]}`;
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] What two ways do we have of setting the value in a property?
- [ ] One of the notations **must** be used under certain conditions. What notation is that and what conditions force you to use it?
- [ ] Why could we use "push"?
- [ ] What happens when you set a key that's not in the object?
- [ ] Can you explain what's going on in the last statement?

---

### let's not worry about these things from the text

It's not that they're not "important" - whatever _that_ means - it's just that we can safely skip over these currently in the course.

- 8.7.2 Object Creation Using Object Constructor
- 8.7.3 Object Destructuring

### 8.7.4 JSON (very useful...and vital to milestone 2)

JavaScript Object Notation - which pretty well everyone just calls JSON - is a "language-independent data interchange format". Huh?

Let's try again.

Remember our earlier wee beasties?

```javascript
let aCuteKitten = {
  name: "Mr. Fluffles",
  ageInWeeks: 3,
  isVaccinated: true,
};

const anAdorablePuppy = {
  name: "Wanita",
  "favorite snacky-snack": { brand: "Hungry Dog", price: 12.43 },
  vaccinationDates: [new Date(1995, 11, 17), new Date(1996, 1, 3)],
};
```

Here is what that kitten looks like in JSON format:

```
`{"name":"Mr. Fluffles","ageInWeeks":3,"isVaccinated":true}`

`{"name":"Wanita","favorite snacky-snack":{"brand":"Hungry Dog","price":12.43},"vaccinationDates":["1995-12-17T07:00:00.000Z","1996-02-03T07:00:00.000Z"]}`
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] What primitive JS type are these?
- [ ] Does the original object code and the JSON version look fairly similar?
- [ ] What do you notice about they property keys? values?

You can convert a JSON string into its associated JS object (including arrays, 'cause those are objects too!) with the `JSON.parse` method. You'll need to do this for milestone 2, so get familiar with the process. They're used in lab 8.14 and TYK#4.

> _Notice how we can say JSON.parse()? That means that there is a built-in object in JS called JSON. And that it has at least one method attached to it. Look at the docs on MDN for more._

Finally, as an aside, I'm not overly crazy about how the text and labs have you put JavaScript in a file with a .json extension. For one, JavaScript is not JSON, so the file name is deceiving. And second, editors (like VS Code) that are "language aware" will whine at you when you use JS in a json file. (shrug)

## questions from y'all during the lecture

### anonymous qs

### Meet qs

## suggestions for success

So what's upcoming in the near future?

- tut-02 on Friday, Sept 24
- the asg-01 milestone 1 submission is tomorrow, Wednesday Sept 22 @ 9:00 PM

Based on these, if I were taking this course, I'd work to:

- make sure my milestone checks all the boxes (and if I'm not sure what a requirement means, check with JP - pronto)

- read the [preview for tut-02](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-3512-202104-001/tutorial-previews/blob/main/tut-02.md), make sure I've done its prerequisites (especially the suggested lab exercises), and make sure I feel comfortable with the skills mentioned. (We'll be talking about functions on Thursday.)
