## 8.8 Functions

Yeah! Functions!

Let's get the picky stuff out of the way. We'll say that...

- a **procedure** is a named block of code that performs some task, and
- a **function** is a procedure that returns something, and
- a **method** is a procedure attached to an object (like "foo".toString())

But usually in JS land, it seems that the word "function" is used most of the time, so we'll just go with the flow and do that. Most of the time.

### 8.81 Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions

### function declarations

This is a lot like what we're used to in Java, with a few minor-ish differences:

```javascript
function performGuitarSolo() {
  console.log('Silence while I perform, plebes!');
  console.log('...');
  console.log('Damn. Did NOT plug it in.');
}

function electionResult(year) {
  const resultForGivenYear = // some result for that year from a DB
  return {
    year: year,
    result: resultForGivenYear
  };
}

// calling (or to be fancy, invoking) these functions

performGuitarSolo();

console.log(performGuitarSolo);  // careful!
console.log(performGuitarSolo()); // I told you to be careful, dammit!

let result = electionResult(year);
console.log(`In ${result.year}, the election result was ${result.result}`);

```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] What _similarities_ do you see between this stuff and Java method declarations?
- [ ] How about _differences_?
- [ ] What is the second function returning?
  - [ ] Do you find that `year: year` thing a bit weird? There's an alternate format you could use...
- [ ] When we `console.log(performGuitarSolo)`, what will show up in the console? How about `console.log(performGuitarSolo())`?
- [ ] What happens if you do a `typeof performGuitarSolo`?
- [ ] What happens if you type `performGuitarSolo` and then type a period in the console?

---

## HOLD UP: WE ACTUALLY DISCOVERED SOME VERY IMPORTANT THINGS

1. Using `typeof`, we see that there seems to be a special type called "function".
2. Using the dot completion thing in the console, we also see that - like with objects - these functions seem to have properties.

**Important takeaway**

> _In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called. In brief, they are Function objects._

##### using Function()

There's actually a `Function` object that lets you do _wonderful_ (oh so much sarcasm) stuff like this:

```javascript
// make a function, crazily
const subtotal = new Function("price,quantity", "return price * quantity");

// use said function
let result = subtotal(100, 3);
```

But please file this little tidbit away in the "I'm definitely not going to need it for 3512 but might have a weird situation in my distant future when I'm a super-duper-JS developer" file.

### function expressions

OK. Now things will get a tad odd.

Take a gander:

```javascript
let emitSound = function bark() {
  return "Woof, I say. Woof.";
};

emitSound();
typeof emitSound();

emitSound;
typeof emitSound;

bark();
bark;
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] What are we seeing here?
- [ ] Try a `emitSound.name`. Huh.

It gets funner, folks. Refresh thy browser and enjoy the ride:

```javascript
let emitSound = function () {
  return "Woof, I say. Woof.";
};

emitSound();
emitSound;
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] What are we seeing here? An **anonymous function**. SUPER IMPORTANT CONCEPT
- [ ] What does `emitSound.name` give you now? Huh. (so wait...it's NOT anonymous?!?)

### why would we use a function expression?!?

To be honest, for our "3512 purposes", we're not going to use them all that often (if ever). But they are used for scoping reasons when you start churning out intermediate/advanced programs.

---

### A BRIEF SANITY-CHECK

- you can create a function...
  - ...with a function declaration
  - ...with a function expression
  - ...via `new Function()` (but please no)
- functions are objects with a special twist: they are callable/invokable (through `()`)
- functions can have a name, or be anonymous

---

### Default Parameters (and parameter flexibility)

What happens in Java when we try and do something like this?

```java
private boolean isSafe(int num) {
  return num >= 0 && num <= 10;
}

isSafe(4);

isSafe();
isSafe(3, 5);
```

I think you see where this is headed...

```javascript
function isSafe(num) {
  return num >= 0 && num <= 10;
}

isSafe(4);

isSafe();
isSafe(3, 5);
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] Are you surprised? I mean...c'mon - you _had_ to see this coming, right?!?
- [ ] Do you get why we're seeing that return value for `isSafe()`? A hint: what value is being passed to `num` when we call `isSafe()`?...

  > _Man, this would make a great midterm/final question...or am I just trying to psych you out?..._

- [ ] What happens to the extra arg in the call `isSafe(3, 5)`?

---

Let's make a small change to our previous code:

```javascript
function isSafe(num = 5) {
  return num >= 0 && num <= 10;
}

isSafe(4);

isSafe();
isSafe(3, 5);
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] What's happening now?

> _So in this example, num is a **default parameter** - a parameter that has a default value if the caller doesn't provide an argument. This is a feature that JS and some other languages have that I really wished Java has. Very useful!_

### Rest Parameters (nice to know, but...)

I'm gonna punt on this one.

## 8.8.2 Nested Functions

Here's another cool thing with JavaScript that you can't do in Java - nest functions.

Compare this:

```javascript
function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
  let subtotal = price * quantity;
  return subtotal + calculateTax(subtotal);
}

function calculateTax(subtotal) {
  let taxRate = 0.05;
  return subtotal * taxRate;
}

calculateTotal(10, 5); // 52.5
```

to this:

```javascript
function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
  let subtotal = price * quantity;
  return subtotal + calculateTax(subtotal);

  function calculateTax(subtotal) {
    let taxRate = 0.05;
    return subtotal * taxRate;
  }
}

calculateTotal(10, 5); // 52.5
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] Feeling cool with that? It's kind of like a helper function...for a function...inside that function. Which is both cool and terrifying.

Things get more interesting. Of **course** they do:

```javascript
function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
  let subtotal = price * quantity;
  return subtotal + calculateTax(subtotal);

  function calculateTax() {
    let taxRate = 0.05;
    return subtotal * taxRate;
  }
}

calculateTotal(10, 5); // 52.5
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] Did you spot the change? What does it mean?
- [ ] Did you feel a bit queasy about where the first return is located? You should! What's the "problem"? What if I told you this was NOT a problem - in JS!

That segues nicely into our next topic...

## 8.8.3 Hoisting in JS (fundamental!)

You want to know this. It's important.

Let's look back at the previous example

## 8.8.4 Callback Functions

## 8.8.5 Objects & Functions Together

## 8.8.6 Function Constructor (Constructor Function!?!?)

## 8.8.7 Arrow Syntax (briefly!)

## 8.9.1 Scope in JS

## 8.9.2 Closures in JS
