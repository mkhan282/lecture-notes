## 8.8 Functions

Yeah! Functions!

Let's get the picky stuff out of the way. We'll say that...

- a **procedure** is a named block of code that performs some task, and
- a **function** is a procedure that returns something, and
- a **method** is a procedure attached to an object (like "foo".toString())

But usually in JS land, it seems that the word "function" is used most of the time, so we'll just go with the flow and do that. Most of the time.

### 8.81 Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions

### function declarations

This is a lot like what we're used to in Java, with a few minor-ish differences:

```javascript
function performGuitarSolo() {
  console.log('Silence while I perform, plebes!');
  console.log('...');
  console.log('Damn. Did NOT plug it in.');
}

function electionResult(year) {
  const resultForGivenYear = // some result for that year from a DB
  return {
    year: year,
    result: resultForGivenYear
  };
}

// calling (or to be fancy, invoking) these functions

performGuitarSolo();

console.log(performGuitarSolo);  // careful!
console.log(performGuitarSolo()); // I told you to be careful, dammit!

let result = electionResult(year);
console.log(`In ${result.year}, the election result was ${result.result}`);

```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] What _similarities_ do you see between this stuff and Java method declarations?
- [ ] How about _differences_?
- [ ] What is the second function returning?
  - [ ] Do you find that `year: year` thing a bit weird? There's an alternate format you could use...
- [ ] When we `console.log(performGuitarSolo)`, what will show up in the console? How about `console.log(performGuitarSolo())`?
- [ ] What happens if you do a `typeof performGuitarSolo`?
- [ ] What happens if you type `performGuitarSolo` and then type a period in the console?

---

## HOLD UP: WE ACTUALLY DISCOVERED SOME VERY IMPORTANT THINGS

1. Using `typeof`, we see that there seems to be a special type called "function".
2. Using the dot completion thing in the console, we also see that - like with objects - these functions seem to have properties.

**Important takeaway**

> _In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called. In brief, they are Function objects._

> From [Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions) on MDN

##### using Function()

There's actually a `Function` object that lets you do _wonderful_ (oh so much sarcasm) stuff like this:

```javascript
// make a function, crazily
const subtotal = new Function("price,quantity", "return price * quantity");

// use said function
let result = subtotal(100, 3);
```

But please file this little tidbit away in the "I'm definitely not going to need it for 3512 but might have a weird situation in my distant future when I'm a super-duper-JS developer" file.

### function expressions

OK. Now things will get a tad odd.

Take a gander:

```javascript
let emitSound = function bark() {
  return "Woof, I say. Woof.";
};

emitSound();
typeof emitSound();

emitSound;
typeof emitSound;

bark();
bark;
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] What are we seeing here?
- [ ] Try a `emitSound.name`. Huh.

It gets funner, folks. Refresh thy browser and enjoy the ride:

```javascript
let emitSound = function () {
  return "Woof, I say. Woof.";
};

emitSound();
emitSound;
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] What are we seeing here? An **anonymous function**. SUPER IMPORTANT CONCEPT
- [ ] What does `emitSound.name` give you now? Huh. (so wait...it's NOT anonymous?!?)

### why would we use a function expression?!?

To be honest, for our "3512 purposes", we're not going to use them all that often (if ever). But they are used for scoping reasons when you start churning out intermediate/advanced programs.

---

### A BRIEF SANITY-CHECK

- you can create a function...
  - ...with a function declaration
  - ...with a function expression
  - ...via `new Function()` (but please no)
- functions are objects with a special twist: they are callable/invokable (through `()`)
- functions can have a name, or be anonymous

---

### Default Parameters (and parameter flexibility)

What happens in Java when we try and do something like this?

```java
private boolean isSafe(int num) {
  return num >= 0 && num <= 10;
}

isSafe(4);

isSafe();
isSafe(3, 5);
```

I think you see where this is headed...

```javascript
function isSafe(num) {
  return num >= 0 && num <= 10;
}

isSafe(4);

isSafe();
isSafe(3, 5);
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] Are you surprised? I mean...c'mon - you _had_ to see this coming, right?!?
- [ ] Do you get why we're seeing that return value for `isSafe()`? A hint: what value is being passed to `num` when we call `isSafe()`?...

  > _Man, this would make a great midterm/final question...or am I just trying to psych you out?..._

- [ ] What happens to the extra arg in the call `isSafe(3, 5)`?

---

Let's make a small change to our previous code:

```javascript
function isSafe(num = 5) {
  return num >= 0 && num <= 10;
}

isSafe(4);

isSafe();
isSafe(3, 5);
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] What's happening now?

> _So in this example, num is a **default parameter** - a parameter that has a default value if the caller doesn't provide an argument. This is a feature that JS and some other languages have that I really wished Java has. Very useful!_

---

### Rest Parameters (nice to know, but...)

I'm gonna punt on this one.

Read this: https://scotch.io/bar-talk/javascripts-three-dots-spread-vs-rest-operators543

## 8.8.2 Nested Functions

Here's another cool thing with JavaScript that you can't do in Java - nest functions.

Compare this:

```javascript
function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
  let subtotal = price * quantity;
  return subtotal + calculateTax(subtotal);
}

function calculateTax(subtotal) {
  let taxRate = 0.05;
  return subtotal * taxRate;
}

calculateTotal(10, 5); // 52.5
```

to this:

```javascript
function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
  let subtotal = price * quantity;
  return subtotal + calculateTax(subtotal);

  function calculateTax(subtotal) {
    let taxRate = 0.05;
    return subtotal * taxRate;
  }
}

calculateTotal(10, 5); // 52.5
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] Feeling cool with that? It's kind of like a helper function...for a function...inside that function. Which is both cool and terrifying.

Things get more interesting. Of **course** they do:

```javascript
function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
  let subtotal = price * quantity;
  return subtotal + calculateTax(subtotal);

  function calculateTax() {
    let taxRate = 0.05;
    return subtotal * taxRate;
  }
}

calculateTotal(10, 5); // 52.5
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] Did you spot the change? What does it mean?
- [ ] Did you feel a bit queasy about where the first return is located? You should! What's the "problem"? What if I told you this was NOT a problem - in JS!

That segues nicely into our next topic...

## 8.8.3 Hoisting in JS (fundamental!)

I'll release a separate screencast on this. It's important.

## 8.8.4 Callback Functions

> _I'm going to bring this up next week when we start talking about event handling...it just makes more sense._

## 8.8.5 Objects & Functions Together

We've already seen that an object can have another object as a property value:

```javascript
const anAdorablePuppy = {
  name: "Wanita",
  "favorite snacky-snack": { brand: "Hungry Dog", price: 12.43 },
  vaccinationDates: [new Date(1995, 11, 17), new Date(1996, 1, 3)],
};
```

We've also learned today that functions are objects in JS - basically, they're objects that are callable.

So it follows (QED, baby!) that an object can have functions as property values:

```javascript
const anAdorablePuppy = {
  name: "Wanita",
  "favorite snacky-snack": { brand: "Hungry Dog", price: 12.43 },
  vaccinationDates: [new Date(1995, 11, 17), new Date(1996, 1, 3)],
  howl: function () {
    console.log("Aroooo!");
  },
  speak: function () {
    console.log(`Greetings, human. I am ${this.name}.`);
  },
  costFaveSnack() {
    return this["favorite snacky-snack"].price;
  },
  vaccination(index) {
    return this.vaccinationDates[index];
  },
};

// let's see what this puppy can do now

anAdorablePuppy.howl(); // don't forget those brackets!
anAdorablePuppy.speak();
anAdorablePuppy.costFaveSnack();
anAdorablePuppy.vaccination(1);
```

---

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] What's another name for these type of functions?
- [ ] What happens if you _do_ forget the brackets?
- [ ] What are the two ways we've illustrated to give an object a function as a property value?
- [ ] What is `this` referring to?
- [ ] What happens if we call a method that doesn't exist?

#### good ole `this`

`this` in JS is not the same beast as in Java, but it can seem like it at times - like in the examples above, where we're calling methods on an object that has those methods.

**For the time being, we'll just let this lie. But we'll need to revisit it eventually.**

## 8.8.6 Function Constructor (Constructor Function!?!?)

Besides using object literals (and the `Object` constructor, which we didn't talk about 'cause it's rarely used), there's another way to make objects that we can now talk about since we're talking about functions today: **constructor functions**. We will NOT shorten this to **constructor**, because that's something different - but, confusingly, related - in JS.

> _The book uses the term 'function coonstructors', but personally I find this a bit confusing, since there is a function constructor `Function()` in JS. That's not what we're talking about here!_

Just like a Java constructor, a JS constructor function is just a procedure. And also like Java, you need to actually invoke that procedure properly - with the `new` keyword - to get things to work the way you intend.

#### a fluffy example

Let's look at an example.

As a reminder, here is the code we used to create a kitten object in the last lecture:

```javascript
let aCuteKitten = {
  name: "Mr. Fluffles",
  ageInWeeks: 3,
  isVaccinated: true,
};
```

If we want to churn out other kitten objects, we _could_ just create a whole bunch of other literals...but that would get pretty tiring pretty quickly.

Instead, we can use a constructor function to get this done:

```javascript
function Kitten(name, age, isVaccinated) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.isVaccinated = isVaccinated;
  this.cry = function () {
    console.log("mew!");
  };
  this.needsVaccination = function () {
    return !this.isVaccinated;
  };
}

// let's make a couple o' kittens

const barb = new Kitten("Barb", 2, false);
barb.cry();
barb.needsVaccination();

let ted = new Kitten("Ted", 4, true);
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] What do we see if we inspect `barb`?
- [ ] How does this feel like a Java constructor?
- [ ] What happens if we don't use `new`?
- [ ] Do we need to use Pascal case for the constructor function?
- [ ] What's returned from the costructor function?

There is a LOT the text does not cover about the guts of what's going on here...but that's perfectly fine. The goal of chapter 8 is not to create a JS intermediate/advanced user.

If you're interested in popping the hood, I strongly recommend looking at [Will Sentances "JavaScript: The Hard Parts, v2" on Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2) - remember you get some free months of this from GitHub Student.

## 8.8.7 Arrow Syntax (briefly!)

Arrow syntax came in with ES6. It's a different way of writing functions _meant_ to be more concise.

It's pretty confusing the first time you see it and only starts being useful (IMO) once you become at least a bit comfortable with regular JS functions.

With that in mind, here's the deal:

- you will be expected to read and write simple arrow syntax for the midterm and final
- tut-03 (next week) will need you to use it a bit
- you don't have to use it for the first assignment
- I will be using it sometimes, especially when we start talking about event handlers (from next week)

## 8.9.1 Scope in JS

> _Need a separate cast for this...I'd read the section in the textbook in the meantime._

## 8.9.2 Closures in JS

> _This will wait until Web 3, though I may need to talk about aspects of it from time to time._
