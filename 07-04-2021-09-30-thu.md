## 9.2.3 DOM Manipulation Methods

So we can make Elements _look_ a certain way by styling them, either inline or via attaching classes to them.

And now we can change the _text_ in Elements.

But what if you want to _add_ or _remove_ Elements? What _then_, hotshot?!?

Let's pop open an Incognito window again and find out.

### removing the stuffs

As is so often in life, it can be easier to destroy than create.

(Yes, back to Incognito Land.)

```javascript
// that icon? IT OFFENDS ME AND MUST BE DESTROYED
document.querySelector("div.icon").remove();

// note that - surprise! - IE doesn't support this. In that case, you
// have to go a bit old-school and get the parent of the thing you
// wish to remove as well:

let parentOfIcon = document.querySelector("div.content");
let dyingIconDiv = document.querySelector("div.icon");
parentOfIcon.removeChild(dyingIconDiv);

// LET THIS BE A LESSON TO YOU ALL

// Now, you want to be careful with remove...
parentOfIcon.remove(); // uh...are you sure you wanna do that, sport?

// oops
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] You can easily remove any Element by just calling its `remove` method. Except if you're using IE, in which case you must do things The Hard Way.
- [ ] The Hard Way involves selecting _both_ the parent of the thing that must perish _and_ the thing that must perish, then using `parent.removeChild(poorDyingThing)`.
- [ ] Be careful with remove (either form) - all Elements _inside_ the thing that's being removed are going buh-bye as well!

### adding simple stuffs

You're probably going to find that creating new Elements is kinda annoying and tedious and you might be tempted to use innerHTML.

Don't.

The way shown here, although a bit more work, is much safer.

Refresh the Incognito window to revive the poor dead stuffs. (Or are they zombies? They're coming to get you, Barbera!)

```javascript
// let's add an h2, 'cause the h1 is so lonely. This is a 2-step process:
// step 1: create the thing you want to insert

const textInH2 = document.createTextNode("But you are not THAT Incognito.");
const h2 = document.createElement("h2");
h2.appendChild(textInH2);
h2; // take a look at what we have wrought

// whew. I'm _exhausted_. Are we done yet?!?

// step 2: add the new thing into the DOM - AT THE RIGHT SPOT

// so we're not done. great
// We might be tempted to try appendChild. Let's see what happens.

const h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
h1.appendChild(h2); // well THAT didn't work (see why?)

// in this case, we want the h2 to be **adjacent to** the h1...
// adjacent to it and right after it:

h1.insertAdjacentElement("afterend", h2); // that string's kinda cheezy
// ... but it worked
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] We can safely make well-formed Elements by using `createElement`.
- [ ] If you want to add text to the Element, you'll use `createTextNode` and then us `appendChild` to attach the text to the element.
  - [ ] As an alternative, you could just use `textContent`. Opinions seem to differ online as to which to use...but they seem to be speed-related. `textContent` seems much easier to use IMO...
- [ ] Making the new Element is only half the battle: you also have to attach the new Element to the DOM! This will typically be done with some kind of `insertBlah` or `appendChild`. MDN...MDN...
  - [ ] There is a [sweet `Element.append()` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/append) you might want to use. Too bad it doesn't work with IE....

### adding not-so-simple stuffs (example 1: `<a>` tag)

So we've added a simple Element that just has some text in it...what if we wanted to create something that had attributes in it, like `<a href>`?

Let's see.

```javascript
// let's replace "You've gone Incognito" with "You've gone Ninja" again...
// ...but this time, let's make "Ninja" link to the Wikipedia page

// step 1: make a new Element to represent the `<a>Ninja</a>` (textbook)
let a = document.createElement("a");
a.setAttribute("href", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja");

let text = document.createTextNode("Ninja");
a.appendChild(text);

// OR

// step 1: make a new Element to represent the `<a>Ninja</a>` (simpler)
let a = document.createElement("a");
a.href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja";
a.text = "Ninja";

// step 2: replace the current text content with new text content
let h1 = document.querySelector("h1");
h1.textContent = "You've gone "; // note space!

// step 3: attach the <a> after the text
h1.appendChild(a);

// WANNA SEE SOMETHING NEAT? Try this:
a.text = "Completely Invisible!"; // total midterm fodder
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] Some tags have essential attributes on them, like `<a>` tags. It's not enough here to `createElement` - we need to make sure the necessary attributes are also added.
- [ ] You can add attributes at least 2 ways that I'm aware of:
  - [ ] (textbook) Use `setAttribute`, or
  - [ ] Look up the documentation for that specific Element and leverage what you find there!
  - [ ] Each way has its benefits.

### adding not-so-simple stuffs (example 2: `<img>` tag)

Because of how Incognito works, I can't play around with images in that page, so let's open up a Google search page and play with it instead.

```javascript
// Let's replace the google img with another one

// step 1: make a new Element for the <img>... we'll add an alt (textbook)
let img = document.createElement("img");
img.setAttribute(
  "src",
  "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CZNTe93lITWeFLNHj3pTmI7iyoe7kP_YlsKyYZ3lJPEAB23wIkv3XMCPW-o59od1"
);
img.setAttribute("alt", "A very incognito lady.");

// step 1: ake a new Element for the <img> (simpler)
let img = document.createElement("img");
img.srcset =
  "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/CZNTe93lITWeFLNHj3pTmI7iyoe7kP_YlsKyYZ3lJPEAB23wIkv3XMCPW-o59od1";
img.alt = "A very incognito lady.";

// step 2: replace the current img with our img
let oldImg = document.querySelectorAll("img")[9];
oldImg.replaceWith(img);
```

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP, LOOK, and THINK</span>

- [ ] We can set multiple attributes using either the "textbook" way, or the "look up that specific Element's properties" way.
- [ ] `replaceWith` is useful for swapping out one Element with another

## Onward!

This was only scratching the surface of the cool stuff that can be done with DOM manipulation. Please feel free to investigate further, using MDN to guide you!

Now it's on to a shorter screencast!
