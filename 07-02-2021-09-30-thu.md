## 9.2.1 Changing an Element's Style

### altering the classes of the element

Use the Elements inspector in your browser to add the following to the body of an Incognito window:

```css
<style>
  /* these are arbitrary styles for demo purposes */
  /* normally this would go in the <head>, but we are beyond rules now */

  .quite-important {
    color: #a832a2;
    font-size: 1.4em;
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  .spacey {
    padding: 10px;
    margin: 15px;
  }

  .bordered {
    border: 5px solid yellow;
  }

</style>
```

To make sure these work, use the inspector to add a class to some tags on the page - observe what happens. (This is just a refresher from Web 1.)

With these in mind, clean up your changes and let's get to work.

```javascript
// let's make that h1 quite-important again, but this time using
// THE POWER OF JAVASCRIPT
const h1 = document.querySelector("h1"); // other ways?
h1.classList; // hit the period what do we see?

// what is this classList thing?

h1.classList.add("quite-important"); // what happened
// no - really. WHAT HAPPENED?
// - well, the quite-important class was added to the <h1> tag
// - quite-important was added to the h1's classList
// - the h1's styles remains unaltered
// - and of course, the h1 is a lovely new color because of the CSS rule

// can we add another class?
h1.classList.add("bordered"); // ayup

// I hate that color
h1.classList.remove("quite-important"); // fine. ingrate
// what's happened to the h1's classList?

// I changed my mind
h1.classList.toggle("quite-important"); // it's like a light switch

// I changed it back
h1.classList.toggle("quite-important"); // stop it

// I think the li's would look better with a border
let listElems = document.querySelectorAll("li");
for (const li of listElems) {
  li.classList.add("bordered");
}

// ew - space them out already
for (const li of listElems) {
  li.classList.add("spacey");
}

// I don't like yellow
for (const li of listElems) {
  li.style.borderColor = "orange"; // notice who wins
}
```

- [ ] We can change the style of any Element by changing that element's class attribute.
- [ ] You'll need to have created some CSS rules for this to work, of course.
- [ ] You use the `add()` method to add classes, `remove()` to remove them, and `toggle()` to toggle them on and off.
- [ ] You can add multiple classes this way.
- [ ] If you want to style multiple things you've selected, you can iterate through those things and use this method.
- [ ] You can typically override class stylings using inline stylings...but you might not want to do this too often.

#### which way should I use?

All things being equal, lean toward using the `classList` methods. Why? Primarily because by doing so, you can have designers doing their thing (making css that does cool stuff and that makes things look niiiiiice) while the devs can focus on their thing (coding witchery).

Of course, sometimes you wear both hats. But you should still strive to follow this rule. It kinda sucks hunting around through a bunch of JS code trying to find out where you made some text `#bada55` or changed the padding on some divs to 2em.
