**2021-09-14(T)**

Recording available here: https://youtu.be/vKmj-fUxh2A

**!!! Start Recording, JP !!!**

## odds & ends

Things pop into my head all the time. I'll start off most lectures with 'em.

- [ ] thought GatherTown was ok. BB not so much. Links up on Discord, too, now.
  - [ ] repurposed area 6 as Help Here
  - [ ] private talks at my "desk". Please respect.
  - [ ] we'll see how this goes. Flexibility important.
- [ ] should I nuke the tutorial sites? what to do about GitHub Classroom links? Fair?
- [ ] is there anyone here taking this course from outside of Calgary? Pure curiosity on my part, that's all.
- [ ] I see as of this morning, we've gone from 11 to 22 (asg-01 acceptors)
- [ ] milestone 1 heads-up: it doesn't have to look _exactly_ that way!
- [ ] another milestone 1 heads-up: it's supposed to be your own work
- [ ] when you're using Netlify, choose the Org
- [ ] when you're doing lab exercises...avoid copying and pasting

## something on your mind?

https://onlinequestions.org (use event number **20210402**) or Meet chat

Please:

- [ ] if you have a question, ask the question
- [ ] if you wonder how I do something "neat", ask the question
  - [ ] keyboard shortcuts and tool comfort are all about keeping you in the flow and not getting sidetracked
- [ ] if anyone has a tip, share it

**Any questions right now?**

## what's that in the distance?

- tut-01 on Friday, Sept 17
- asg-01 milestone 1 submission on Wednesday, Sept 22

## today's topics

tut-01 will deal with topics up to concatenation, which is covered in textbook section 8.3.4, so the plan is to cover up to that chapter as quickly as possible and then keep a couple of steps ahead of the tutorials for the rest of the course. That way, tuts _should_ be a good review/recall exercise for you.

As much as possible, we'll "[I'll do, we do, you do](https://www.gcu.edu/blog/engineering-technology/how-use-i-do-we-do-you-do-teaching)"

This means that when we cover JS coding topics, I'll introduce it, demo it...and then get you to try something with me. I'll use breakout rooms sometimes.

#### chapter-starting note

- no additional tools
- idiosyncrasies and complexities (coercion, var, scoping, closures, async programming)
- assumption that you have familiarity with another language - leverage your Java know-how
  - **but** "JavaScript is to Java as ham is to hamster." (Jeremy Keith, 2009)

#### 8.1 What Is JavaScript and What Can It Do?

**"[JS] is an object-oriented, dynamically typed scripting language"**  
_(Ullman, Modern Java Script: Develop and Design)_

##### object-oriented

_almost everything, including functions are objects_

- [Java] if something is an object, what 2 things does it have?
- [!Java] objects are prototype-based, not class-based (though JS now has classes...but not really)
- "variables are objects"? what?

> **let's we do**
>
> >
>
> 1. pop open an incognito console `ctrl + shift + n` > `ctrl + shift + i`
> 2. type in some stuffs from Java that you're familiar with and hit period. Intriguing....
> 3. try creating some variables and do the same thing. Notice anything?

##### dynamically typed

- [!Java] statically typed. (draw memory)
- other dynamically typed languages
- which is better?

##### client-side scripting language

Let's talk about that next in more detail

#### 8.1.1 Client-Side Scripting

- **client-side** => usually refers to browser, good enough for this course
- your browser and JS (to the whiteboard!)
- so your browser has a JS "engine" (V8 engine for Chrome) that "knows" JS
  - we couldn't play with the console otherwise! :)
  - a lot of the things we use and say are JS (alert, console.log, prompt) aren't JS - they're part of Web APIs that your **browser** knows and which follow JS **syntax**. Don't believe me? Let's search the [ECMAScript 2022 spec](https://tc39.es/ecma262/)...

##### pros

- much processing can move from server => client (reducing server load)
- client's "right there" (no talk with server needed) => better ux possible
- JS can interact with the HTML/CSS "right there" => better ux possible

##### probs

- can't guarantee JS enabled...

  > **let's do**
  >
  > disable your JS a number of different ways (hello, mtroyal....)
  >
  > - settings > privacy and security > site settings > JavaScript (whew!) see the icon? try searching...ouch bad design - but try apple.com...humour!
  > - open devtools and `ctrl + shift + p` (warning - kinda misbehaves if used in combination with "long" way)

- as with any large codebase, sites using a lot of JS can get hard to debug/maintain
- failure is hidden from user, making things just "not work" ... need to open console to have a chance to see errors
- browser support for all language features - especially new ones - is not fully supported and, sometimes worse, supported differently

  > **let's do**
  >
  > how do you find out support? I suggest MDN (Mozilla Developer Network). GET TO KNOW THIS SITE and add "mdn" to your searches
  >
  > - search for compatibility info on `Math.max`
  > - how about "array flatten mdn"?

##### not in textbook: parsing

- you could argue it's _not_ a scripted language...there's a parsing step that occurs
- we'll see proof of this when we start running some of our programs

#### 8.1.2 JavaScriptâ€™s History

- interesting how marketing decisions can cause a lot of confusion and what seems like a "good idea at the time" becomes something we have to live with
- small aside: Oracle (now "own" Java) also "own" the trademark for the name "JavaScript"
  - to make matters more confusing, JavaScript is just one implementation of the language standard ECMAScript
  - you can find this at the link referred to in [8.1.1](#811-client-side-scripting)

#### 8.1.3 JavaScript and Web 2.0

- ...and this is how a language works its way so deeply into the web that you're "stuck" with language design decisions.

"You can't take something off the Internet. It's like taking pee out of a pool." quote

#### 8.1.4 JavaScript in Contemporary Software Development

Takeaway here? If you become "good at JS", you've got a TON of career opportunities ahead of you.

---

Time to dive in, play with the language, and learn a few practical things.

Avoid just watching - code along! Since we'll be doing this kind of thing a LOT, you should try and have a home where you keep all your lecture coding adventures, with one folder per lecture. (VS Code will give you fewer headaches if you try and keep individual works in their own folder.)

To get ready:

1. create a home directory for your lecture playtimes
2. create a directory for today's lecture
3. right-click folder to open (no right-click menu? I'd fix, but you can File > Open Folder)

   > _Why is my side bar on the right? How do you move it?_

4. make an index.html with Emmet

   > _Emmet is awesome. Look at what you can do. There's a cheat sheet._

5. make an index.js
6. link em up
7. Live Preview or Server and we're off!

   **tip**
   Work in incognito mode (why?). Shortcut in Chrome is Ctrl+Shift+n

   **tip**
   Inspect w/ `Ctrl + Shift + i`. Toggle console with `Esc`.

   **tip**
   paste the URL into an Incognito window (`ctrl + shift + n`) to avoid extensions polluting your JS experience

   **tip**
   Live Preview in Internal Browser mode makes finding elements hard (buried deep). Suggest using an external browser by default.

**We'll use this setup a lot. When a new lecture rolls around, copy-paste your folder, re-name it, and you're done. If you do this **before** the lecture starts, even better.**

---

#### 8.2 Where Does JavaScript Go?

#### 8.2.1 Inline JavaScript

It's possible.
Don't do it. It's a maintenance nightmare.

#### 8.2.2 Embedded JavaScript

- We can put `<script>` in head or body.

- This is nice if you're puttering around trying something out - FWIW I do it quite a bit.

- Don't use it in "real-life" situations unless your shop requires it or you have other compelling reasons to do so.

#### 8.2.3 External JavaScript

- Preferred method.
- Location?
  - head a lot of time. Usually after CSS links (performance)
  - before `</body>` for performance (good) or for DOM manip (not so good)

> _Order matters!_

**gotcha**
Live Preview and alerts/prompts is...tres annoying

#### 8.2.4 Users without JavaScript

We've already puttered with this today.

#### 8.3 Variables and Data Types

- [Java] JS has variables, is case-sensitive, uses semicolons (kind of), is flexible with "extra" whitespace, and has naming conventions similar (camel case)
- [!Java] JS is dynamically typed, so you don't declare with a type. Use `var`,`let`, or `const`.

### Detour: Predictions

Predicting things has been shown by research - real research - to be a very effective learning tool. If you don't know something, trying to predict behaviour starts the process of tying a new thing into things you already know. That's a super-good thing.

If you **do** already know something - or at least have learned it before somehow - prediction becomes a form of recall, which is one of the best ways to make something stick in your neo-cortex.

I'm going to ask you to predict things quite often. You should do so, instead of just waiting for the answer or just pasting stuff and seeing what happens.

---

**predict**: what value does foo have after **all** these lines have run?

```javascript
//

let foo = 32;
foo = true;
foo = "bar";

// check whether your prediction was correct - type foo into your console!
// (that's kinda neat, eh? notice how it's greyed out? hmm....)
```

> Q. what did you just learn?

**HERE ENDETH THE LESSON**

## questions from y'all during the lecture

### anonymous qs

1. Will you be recording the lecture?
   - See [Section Details in the course outline](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-3512-202104-001/course-outline#section-details)
2. Will there be any hex map equivalent assignments?
   - No. I'm sorry for the emotional trauma. (This question is a bit of an in-joke for those who had 1501 with me one semester. Can be swapped out with Josephus for a different semeser.)
3. Can we show it [the first milestone] to you before we submit it?
   - No ... this would be huge time suck and isn't necessary anyway. I think the requirements are very clear and y'all can figure out what I want. However, I realize that I, being human, might _think_ I'm being clear, when I'm actually _totally not being so_. So with that in mind, if you have any questions about a requirement, let me know. If I think a requirement can be reworded to remove confusion, I will certainly do so!
4. How long do you expect the milestone 1 to normally take?
   - I have no clue...far too many variables. Someone who does this for a living could prolly bang it out in under an hour. The rest of us? A number > 1 hour.
5. Do we get bonus marks if we sub to your YT channel?
   - No, but you **do** nurture my fragile, fragile ego.
6. We dont need the book right?
   - There's no way to answer this to everyone's liking. Here's my take, though: I use the textbook to determine what topics to cover in tutorials, the content of the lectures, and (generally) the order I present things. Knowing that, someone with the textbook would seem to have certain advantages over someone without it. And yes, someone could - and likely **will** - be very successful in this course without the textbook.
7. Will COMP 1701 be a first year programming course?
   - Yes. First course both CS **and** BCIS students take...and yes, that means people from both streams would be in the same class!
8. JP sorry to interrupt but are we going to be using API's in this course?
   - I like questions! (well, most of them). In this course, we'll be using some of the [standard Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API). You'll also be consuming some APIs Randy made for the assignment (see the assignment 1 writeup). Also, in assignment 2, you'll be making your own web API.
9. Will you upload lecture notes after the lecture is over?
   - It might take a few hours (since I have to get from my basement to MRU + do my usual job), but my intent is to always make my notes available to you. Keep in mind that life is weird, so I might forget to push my notes from home and be hosed at work...or I might just plain forget to do it sometimes. Feel free to nudge me if things aren't up by the end of the day of the lecture.
10. Can we go above and beyond in assignments for fun, like using webgl or something like that?
    - Possibly. If you don't eat your meat you can't have any pudding. (If you get the requirements for the assignment done, then you can go to town. Also, when in doubt, come and talk to me.)
11. No support means it definitely won't work?
    - Give it a try! Use MDN to find something that's not supported by a browser and see what happens!
12. Also isn't the new kid on the block typescript which is being made by Microsoft?
    - Typescripts pretty popular. Definitely has its perks. Still import to know vanilla JS!
13. Can this [course? JS skills?] essentially lead to software developer?
    - I certainly hope so!
14. Can we store the semicolon in a let variable?
    - Behave, you.
15. When is the tutorial 1 link going to up?

    - From the [Tutorial Exercises section of the course outline:](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-3512-202104-001/course-outline#tutorial-exercises)

      > _About 5 minutes before the start of tutorials, you'll be given access to a link to the full instructions for that tutorial._

### Meet qs

1. (in regards to let/var, I think) How would constants work?
   - We'll discuss constants in next lecture.
2. So generally websites with JavaScript will be loading up slower because there are two requests which needs to be processed?
   - Every request/response trip, no matter what kind of file (css, js) will affect the user experience. If you wanna be serious with this stuff, take a look at the [Network panel in the dev tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/).

## tips brought up

Here are some tips brought up by me and y'all during the lecture:

#### Chrome shortcuts (might work in other browsers)

[Canonical reference here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/shortcuts/).

- `Ctrl + Shift + n`: open new Incognito window
- `Ctrl + Shift + i`: open up dev tools
  - `Ctrl + Shift + j`: just open the Console...I did not know this!
- `Ctrl + Shift + p`: (while in dev tools) open the Command Menu
- `Esc`: (while in dev tools) toggle the Console

#### VS Code tips

[Default VS Code shortcuts here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_default-keyboard-shortcuts)

- move Side Bar to right (right-click on Side Bar > "Move Side Bar Right") to stop your code from boppin' around
- `Ctrl + b`: toggle Side Bar visibility
- `Ctrl + +`: bump up zoom
- `Ctrl + -`: bump down zoom

#### Emmet

One student said:

> _cool trick (idk if everybody knows it or not) but if you type div.classname and then hit enter it'll create a div with that class name, same goes for id. it just saves time_

This is true. Emmet can do this and so much more. Google "Emmet cheat sheet", or pull up some vids on it. It's stupidly, stupidly useful to know at least _some_ Emmet.

## suggestions for success

So what's upcoming in the near future?
