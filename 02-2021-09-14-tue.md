## odds & ends

- [ ] thought GatherTown was ok. BB not so much. Links up on Discord, too, now.
  - [ ] repurposed area 6 as Help Here
  - [ ] private talks at my "desk". Please respect.
  - [ ] we'll see how this goes. Flexibility important.
- [ ] should I nuke the tutorial sites? what to do about GitHub Classroom links? Fair?
- [ ] is there anyone here taking this course from outside of Calgary? Pure curiosity on my part, that's all.
- [ ] milestone 1 heads-up: it doesn't have to look _exactly_ that way!
- [ ] another milestone 1 heads-up: it's supposed to be your own work
- [ ] when you're using Netlify, choose the Org
- [ ] when you're doing lab exercises...avoid copying and pasting

## something on your mind?

https://onlinequestions.org (use event number **20210402**) or Meet chat

Please:

- [ ] if you have a question, ask the question
- [ ] if you wonder how I do something "neat", ask the question
  - [ ] keyboard shortcuts and tool comfort are all about keeping you in the flow and not getting sidetracked

**Any questions right now?**

## what's ahead?

- tut-01 on Friday, Sept 17
- asg-01 milestone 1 submission on Wednesday, Sept 22

## today's topics

tut-01 will deal with topics up to concatenation, which is covered in textbook section 8.3.4, so the plan is to cover up to that chapter today and Thursday.

As much as possible, we'll "[I'll do, we do, you do](https://www.gcu.edu/blog/engineering-technology/how-use-i-do-we-do-you-do-teaching)"

This means that when we start covering actual JS coding topics, I'll introduce it, demo it...and then get you to try something with me. I'll use breakout rooms sometimes.

### chapter topics

#### 8.1 What Is JavaScript and What Can It Do?

#### 8.1.1 Client-Side Scripting

- a lot of the things we use and say are JS (alert, console.log, prompt) aren't JS. Don't believe me? Let's search the ECMAScript spec...

#### 8.1.2 JavaScriptâ€™s History

#### 8.1.3 JavaScript and Web 2.0

- ...and this is how a language works its way so deeply into the web that you're "stuck" with language design decisions.

"You can't take something off the Internet. It's like taking pee out of a pool." quote

#### 8.1.4 JavaScript in Contemporary Software Development

#### 8.2 Where Does JavaScript Go?

**tip**
Work in incognito mode (why?). Shortcut in Chrome is Ctrl+Shift+n

**tip**
Inspect w/ `Ctrl + Shift + i`. Toggle console with `Esc`.

**gotcha**
Live Preview doesn't show line numbers for errors rationally.

**gotcha**
Live Preview has issues with finding elements (buried deep).

**gotcha**
webhint plugin is a bit...chatty

#### 8.2.1 Inline JavaScript

#### 8.2.2 Embedded JavaScript

#### 8.2.3 External JavaScript

#### 8.2.4 Users without JavaScript

**tip**
Toggle JS on/off with `Ctrl+Shift+P`, search. (Those keycombs work in VS Code, too.)

#### 8.3 Variables and Data Types

#### 8.3.1 JavaScript Output

#### 8.3.2 Data Types

#### 8.3.3 Built-In Objects

#### 8.3.4 Concatenation [tut-01 cutoff topic]

**HERE ENDETH THE LESSON**

## questions from y'all during the lecture

### anonymous qs

1. Will you be recording the lecture?
   - See [Section Details in the course outline](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-3512-202104-001/course-outline#section-details)
2. Will there be any hex map equivalent assignments?
   - No. I'm sorry for the emotional trauma. (This question is a bit of an in-joke for those who had 1501 with me one semester. Can be swapped out with Josephus for a different semeser.)
3. Can we show it [the first milestone] to you before we submit it?
   - No ... this would be huge time suck and isn't necessary anyway. I think the requirements are very clear and y'all can figure out what I want. However, I realize that I, being human, might _think_ I'm being clear, when I'm actually _totally not being so_. So with that in mind, if you have any questions about a requirement, let me know. If I think a requirement can be reworded to remove confusion, I will certainly do so!
4. How long do you expect the milestone 1 to normally take?
   - I have no clue...far too many variables. Someone who does this for a living could prolly bang it out in under an hour. The rest of us? A number > 1 hour.
5. Do we get bonus marks if we sub to your YT channel?
   - No, but you **do** nurture my fragile, fragile ego.
6. We dont need the book right?
   - There's no way to answer this to everyone's liking. Here's my take, though: I use the textbook to determine what topics to cover in tutorials, the content of the lectures, and (generally) the order I present things. Knowing that, someone with the textbook would seem to have certain advantages over someone without it. And yes, someone could - and likely **will** - be very successful in this course without the textbook.
7. Will COMP 1701 be a first year programming course?
   - Yes. First course both CS **and** BCIS students take...and yes, that means people from both streams would be in the same class!
8. JP sorry to interrupt but are we going to be using API's in this course?
   - I like questions! (well, most of them). In this course, we'll be using some of the [standard Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API). You'll also be consuming some APIs Randy made for the assignment (see the assignment 1 writeup). Also, in assignment 2, you'll be making your own web API.
9. Will you upload lecture notes after the lecture is over?
   - It might take a few hours (since I have to get from my basement to MRU + do my usual job), but my intent is to always make my notes available to you. Keep in mind that life is weird, so I might forget to push my notes from home and be hosed at work...or I might just plain forget to do it sometimes. Feel free to nudge me if things aren't up by the end of the day of the lecture.
10. Can we go above and beyond in assignments for fun, like using webgl or something like that?
    - Possibly. If you don't eat your meat you can't have any pudding. (If you get the requirements for the assignment done, then you can go to town. Also, when in doubt, come and talk to me.)
11. No support means it definitely won't work?
    - Give it a try! Use MDN to find something that's not supported by a browser and see what happens!
12. Also isn't the new kid on the block typescript which is being made by Microsoft?
    - Typescripts pretty popular. Definitely has its perks. Still import to know vanilla JS!
13. Can this [course? JS skills?] essentially lead to software developer?
    - I certainly hope so!
14. Can we store the semicolon in a let variable?
    - Behave, you.
15. When is the tutorial 1 link going to up?

    - From the [Tutorial Exercises section of the course outline:](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-3512-202104-001/course-outline#tutorial-exercises)

      > _About 5 minutes before the start of tutorials, you'll be given access to a link to the full instructions for that tutorial._

### Meet qs

1. (in regards to let/var, I think) How would constants work?
   - We'll discuss constants in next lecture.
2. So generally websites with JavaScript will be loading up slower because there are two requests which needs to be processed?
   - Every request/response trip, no matter what kind of file (css, js) will affect the user experience. If you wanna be serious with this stuff, take a look at the [Network panel in the dev tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/).

## tips brought up

Here are some tips brought up by me and y'all during the lecture:

#### Chrome shortcuts (might work in other browsers)

[Canonical reference here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/shortcuts/).

- `Ctrl + Shift + n`: open new Incognito window
- `Ctrl + Shift + i`: open up dev tools
  - `Ctrl + Shift + j`: just open the Console...I did not know this!
- `Ctrl + Shift + p`: (while in dev tools) open the Command Menu
- `Esc`: (while in dev tools) toggle the Console

#### VS Code tips

[Default VS Code shortcuts here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_default-keyboard-shortcuts)

- move Side Bar to right (right-click on Side Bar > "Move Side Bar Right") to stop your code from boppin' around
- `Ctrl + b`: toggle Side Bar visibility
- `Ctrl + +`: bump up zoom
- `Ctrl + -`: bump down zoom

#### Emmet

One student said:

> _cool trick (idk if everybody knows it or not) but if you type div.classname and then hit enter it'll create a div with that class name, same goes for id. it just saves time_

This is true. Emmet can do this and so much more. Google "Emmet cheat sheet", or pull up some vids on it. It's stupidly, stupidly useful to know at least _some_ Emmet.

## suggestions for success

So what's upcoming in the near future?
