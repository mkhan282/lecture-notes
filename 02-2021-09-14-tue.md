Recording available here:

**!!! Start Recording, JP !!!**

## odds & ends

Things pop into my head all the time. I'll start off most lectures with 'em.

- [ ] thought GatherTown was ok. BB not so much. Links up on Discord, too, now.
  - [ ] repurposed area 6 as Help Here
  - [ ] private talks at my "desk". Please respect.
  - [ ] we'll see how this goes. Flexibility important.
- [ ] should I nuke the tutorial sites? what to do about GitHub Classroom links? Fair?
- [ ] is there anyone here taking this course from outside of Calgary? Pure curiosity on my part, that's all.
- [ ] I see as of this morning, we've gone from 11 to 22 (asg-01 acceptors)
- [ ] milestone 1 heads-up: it doesn't have to look _exactly_ that way!
- [ ] another milestone 1 heads-up: it's supposed to be your own work
- [ ] when you're using Netlify, choose the Org
- [ ] when you're doing lab exercises...avoid copying and pasting

## something on your mind?

https://onlinequestions.org (use event number **20210402**) or Meet chat

Please:

- [ ] if you have a question, ask the question
- [ ] if you wonder how I do something "neat", ask the question
  - [ ] keyboard shortcuts and tool comfort are all about keeping you in the flow and not getting sidetracked
- [ ] if anyone has a tip, share it

**Any questions right now?**

## what's that in the distance?

- tut-01 on Friday, Sept 17
- asg-01 milestone 1 submission on Wednesday, Sept 22

## today's topics

tut-01 will deal with topics up to concatenation, which is covered in textbook section 8.3.4, so the plan is to cover up to that chapter as quickly as possible and then keep a couple of steps ahead of the tutorials for the rest of the course. That way, tuts _should_ be a good review/recall exercise for you.

As much as possible, we'll "[I'll do, we do, you do](https://www.gcu.edu/blog/engineering-technology/how-use-i-do-we-do-you-do-teaching)"

This means that when we cover JS coding topics, I'll introduce it, demo it...and then get you to try something with me. I'll use breakout rooms sometimes.

#### chapter-starting note

- no additional tools
- idiosyncrasies and complexities (coercion, var, scoping, closures, async programming)
- assumption that you have familiarity with another language - leverage your Java know-how
  - **but** "JavaScript is to Java as ham is to hamster." (Jeremy Keith, 2009)

#### 8.1 What Is JavaScript and What Can It Do?

**"[JS] is an object-oriented, dynamically typed scripting language"**  
_(Ullman, Modern Java Script: Develop and Design)_

##### object-oriented

_almost everything, including functions are objects_

- [Java] if something is an object, what 2 things does it have?
- [!Java] objects are prototype-based, not class-based (though JS now has classes...but not really)
- "variables are objects"? what?

> **let's we do**
>
> >
>
> 1. pop open an incognito console `ctrl + shift + n` > `ctrl + shift + i`
> 2. type in some stuffs from Java that you're familiar with and hit period. Intriguing....
> 3. try creating some variables and do the same thing. Notice anything?

##### dynamically typed

- [!Java] statically typed. (draw memory)
- other dynamically typed languages
- which is better?

##### client-side scripting language

Let's talk about that next in more detail

#### 8.1.1 Client-Side Scripting

- **client-side** => usually refers to browser, good enough for this course
- your browser and JS (to the whiteboard!)
- so your browser has a JS "engine" (V8 engine for Chrome) that "knows" JS
  - we couldn't play with the console otherwise! :)
  - a lot of the things we use and say are JS (alert, console.log, prompt) aren't JS - they're part of Web APIs that your **browser** knows and which follow JS **syntax**. Don't believe me? Let's search the [ECMAScript 2022 spec](https://tc39.es/ecma262/)...

##### pros

- much processing can move from server => client (reducing server load)
- client's "right there" (no talk with server needed) => better ux possible
- JS can interact with the HTML/CSS "right there" => better ux possible

##### probs

- can't guarantee JS enabled...

  > **let's do**
  >
  > disable your JS a number of different ways (hello, mtroyal....)
  >
  > - settings > privacy and security > site settings > JavaScript (whew!) see the icon? try searching...ouch bad design - but try apple.com...humour!
  > - open devtools and `ctrl + shift + p` (warning - kinda misbehaves if used in combination with "long" way)

- as with any large codebase, sites using a lot of JS can get hard to debug/maintain
- failure is hidden from user, making things just "not work" ... need to open console to have a chance to see errors
- browser support for all language features - especially new ones - is not fully supported and, sometimes worse, supported differently

  > **let's do**
  >
  > how do you find out support? I suggest MDN (Mozilla Developer Network). GET TO KNOW THIS SITE and add "mdn" to your searches
  >
  > - search for compatibility info on `Math.max`
  > - how about "array flatten mdn"?

##### not in textbook: parsing

- you could argue it's _not_ a scripted language...there's a parsing step that occurs
- we'll see proof of this when we start running some of our programs

#### 8.1.2 JavaScriptâ€™s History

- interesting how marketing decisions can cause a lot of confusion and what seems like a "good idea at the time" becomes something we have to live with
- small aside: Oracle (now "own" Java) also "own" the trademark for the name "JavaScript"
  - to make matters more confusing, JavaScript is just one implementation of the language standard ECMAScript
  - you can find this at the link referred to in [8.1.1](#811-client-side-scripting)

#### 8.1.3 JavaScript and Web 2.0

- ...and this is how a language works its way so deeply into the web that you're "stuck" with language design decisions.

"You can't take something off the Internet. It's like taking pee out of a pool." quote

#### 8.1.4 JavaScript in Contemporary Software Development

Takeaway here? If you become "good at JS", you've got a TON of career opportunities ahead of you.

---

Time to dive in, play with the language, and learn a few practical things.

Avoid just watching - code along! Since we'll be doing this kind of thing a LOT, you should try and have a home where you keep all your lecture coding adventures, with one folder per lecture. (VS Code will give you fewer headaches if you try and keep individual works in their own folder.)

To get ready:

1. create a home directory for your lecture playtimes
2. create a directory for today's lecture
3. right-click folder to open (no right-click menu? I'd fix, but you can File > Open Folder)

   > _Why is my side bar on the right? How do you move it?_

4. make an index.html with Emmet

   > _Emmet is awesome. Look at what you can do. There's a cheat sheet._

5. make an index.js
6. link em up
7. Live Preview or Server and we're off!

   **tip**
   Work in incognito mode (why?). Shortcut in Chrome is Ctrl+Shift+n

   **tip**
   Inspect w/ `Ctrl + Shift + i`. Toggle console with `Esc`.

   **tip**
   paste the URL into an Incognito window (`ctrl + shift + n`) to avoid extensions polluting your JS experience

   **tip**
   Live Preview in Internal Browser mode makes finding elements hard (buried deep). Suggest using an external browser by default.

**We'll use this setup a lot. When a new lecture rolls around, copy-paste your folder, re-name it, and you're done. If you do this **before** the lecture starts, even better.**

#### 8.2 Where Does JavaScript Go?

#### 8.2.1 Inline JavaScript

It's possible.
Don't do it. It's a maintenance nightmare.

#### 8.2.2 Embedded JavaScript

- We can put `<script>` in head or body.

- This is nice if you're puttering around trying something out - FWIW I do it quite a bit.

- Don't use it in "real-life" situations unless your shop requires it or you have other compelling reasons to do so.

#### 8.2.3 External JavaScript

- Preferred method.
- Location?
  - head a lot of time. Usually after CSS links (performance)
  - before `</body>` for performance (good) or for DOM manip (not so good)

> _Order matters!_

**gotcha**
Live Preview and alerts/prompts is...tres annoying

#### 8.2.4 Users without JavaScript

We've already puttered with this today.

#### 8.3 Variables and Data Types

- [Java] JS has variables, is case-sensitive, uses semicolons (kind of), is flexible with "extra" whitespace, and has naming conventions similar (camel case)
- [!Java] JS is dynamically typed, so you don't declare with a type. Use `var`,`let`, or `const`.

### Detour: Predictions

Predicting things has been shown by research - real research - to be a very effective learning tool. If you don't know something, trying to predict behaviour starts the process of tying a new thing into things you already know. That's a super-good thing.

If you **do** already know something - or at least have learned it before somehow - prediction becomes a form of recall, which is one of the best ways to make something stick in your neo-cortex.

I'm going to ask you to predict things quite often. You should do so, instead of just waiting for the answer or just pasting stuff and seeing what happens.

---

**predict**: what value does foo have after **all** these lines have run?

```javascript
//

let foo = 32;
foo = true;
foo = "bar";

// check whether your prediction was correct - type foo into your console!
// (that's kinda neat, eh? notice how it's greyed out? hmm....)
```

> Q. what did you just learn?

---

**predict**: what value does foo have after **all** these lines have run?

```javascript
var foo = 32;
foo = true;
foo = "bar";

// check
```

> Q. what did you just learn?

---

**predict**: what value does foo have after **all** these lines have run?

```javascript
const foo = 32;
foo = true;
foo = "bar";

// check
```

> Q. what did you just learn?

---

**predict**: what value does foo have after **all** these lines have run?

```javascript
let foo;

// check
```

> Q. what did you just learn?

---

// predict: what will happen when this code is run?

```javascript
let foo = 32;
foo = true;
foo = bar;

// check
```

> Q. what did you just learn?

#### var, let, const

- Table 8.1 in the book (p. 361) has a nice summary
- suggest you use let, const...but you need to know var on sight (and be comfortable with its quirks if you intend to work "in industry")
- we'll be talking more about scope issues and these keywords later in the chapter

#### 8.3.1 JavaScript Output

##### alert and prompt

- we'll start with `alert` and `prompt`for user-interactive output and input...but move away quickly
  - remember: not really JS!
  - these have docs on MDN. You should look there.

##### console

- `console.log()` is insanely useful and common

**predict:**

```javascript
console.log("yo");

// check
```

**predict:**

```javascript
console.log("yo", 3);

// check
```

**predict:**

```javascript
let x = 4;
console.warn(x * 2);

x = 10;
console.error(x * 2);

// check
```

> Q. What have you learned?

**gotcha**

Notice anything about the line numbers that Live Preview is reporting? How does that differ from Live Server output?

##### document.write()

- can use this to "write" stuff to our HTML doc dynamically:

**predict:**

```javascript
let name = prompt("Yer name?");

document.write("<h1>" + name + "</h1>");

// check
```

- this is actually a pretty bad idea except for use when puttering
  - can have unpredictable effects
  - can be a security hole
  - doesn't get added to the DOM, which severely limits its usefulness (more on this when we hit chapter 9)

#### 8.3.2 Data Types

- [Java] we've got primitive types and reference types
- [!Java] our primitive list is quite a bit different. From MDN:

  - Boolean
  - Number
  - String
  - Null (weird)
  - Undefined (weird)
  - BigInt (not in text...don't worry 'bout it)
  - Symbol (advanced...don't worry 'bout it)

- [Java] visualizing memory is useful, especially when references are involved

  - going to the whiteboard

- thoughts out there on `const` use:
  - use it whenever possible...what's the harm?
  - only use it when it's "meant" to be used
  - you can SCREAMING_CASE if you want, but...

#### 8.3.3 Built-In Objects

#### 8.3.4 Concatenation [tut-01 cutoff topic]

- pick a style and be consistent (or follow your shop's rules)
- just because you **can** use ` all the time doesn't mean you should - it has a meaning and sends a signal to readers; don't mess with their heads

## questions from y'all during the lecture

### anonymous qs

### Meet qs

## suggestions for success

So what's upcoming in the near future?

- tut-01 on Friday, Sept 17
- the asg-01 milestone 1 submission on Wednesday, Sept 22

Based on these, if I were taking this course, I'd work to:

- make sure I'm super-comfortable cloning a tutorial onto my machine. Ideally, I wanna do that without having to think too much or fumble around...the second the GitHub Classroom link goes live, I wanna have the repo on my machine and start reading the instructions within 60 seconds. If I wasn't at that point, I'd practice until I _was_ at that point.

- read the [preview for tut-01](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-3512-202104-001/tutorial-previews/blob/main/tut-01.md), make sure I've done its prerequisites (especially the suggested lab exercises), and make sure I feel comfortable with all the skills mentioned.

- be well into the suggestions mentioned in the "assignment nudge" announcement on Blackboard made on September 12.

```

```
