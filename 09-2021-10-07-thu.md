## Odds & Ends In JP's Head

- I'm seriously considering moving the milestone 3 submission deadline to Friday the 29th. (_No offense, it's not necessarily for you...it's just that I have to mark milestone 3 + the midterm, so I need the whole dang weekend!_)

## What Should Be On My Radar?

- tut-04 (today should be useful)
- asg-1 milestone 2
  - due W...help available, but....
  - official milestone 3 out over Reading Week, but you can get the gist from the assignment-01 doc
  - I will likely punt the figuring out of the Google Map to you

## What's Today About?

We're hitting the playground today: we'll go through 4 coding examples that'll provide you with some more experience with bubbling and event delegation. (You'll also find some of the things we do useful for the tutorial tomorrow and for the assignment.)

There is some material that I'm going to leave to you to look up on your own: the form-related stuff. Since you don't need a form on the assignment, I wanted to use our valuable time elsewhere. You can always find more detailed info about forms later if necessary.

## Playground 01: A Bubbling Review of Sorts

Here's a simple page, along with some css, and JS: https://floobits.com/jpratt-mru/lec-09/file/playground-01/start

You can also get it here: [lecture notes code examples](/lecture-code-examples/lec-09-playground-01)

Let's eyeball the code and I'll axe youse guys some questions:

1. There are some Event Handlers in here. Name 2.
1. How many events is the `<body>` listening for? What are they?
1. What method do we use on an Element to register an event handler with it?
1. Look at the function `logit` and tell me this:
   1. What type of thing will be in the parameter `e` when `logit` is called?
   2. What's the difference between `e.target` and `e.currentTarget`?
1. If I type anywhere but Bobby Bob, what do you think will happen?
1. I'll click on Cletus. I'll tell you that the button will "dip" on the screen. You tell me what else will happen.
1. I'll mouse over Sally Mae. I'll tell you that her text will scramble. You tell me what else will happen.
1. I'll type some text in Bobby Bob. I'll tell you that he'll shake like he's being electrocuted. You tell me what else will happen.
1. We're currently using `this` in `shake` (and other handlers as well). If we added the `e` parameter, is there something else we could use in `this`'s place?
1. If I uncomment the `addEventListener` call on the last line what will happen if I click on Cletus? What if I click on Sally Mae? Bobby Bob? Ma? The Outer-Pen? Explain what you're seeing.
1. If I change the event being listened for in that last line from "click" to "mouseenter", what do you think will happen when I move my mouse into the kids? Explain this. (TRICKY)

### stopPropagation

If you want to stop bubbling from happening, you can. You can add an `e.stopPropagation()` call.

For example, try this:

1. make Ma react to input events
2. try typing in Bobby Bob. Psychedelic!
3. change shake() so that it takes in an event and add an `e.stopPropagation()`

You can read more about that in the text and on MDN.

## Event Delegation

### A quick refresher

The idea behind delegation is to use the fact that events bubble to our advantage. Since every Element basically hollers out that it has experienced an Event to its immediate parent (who in turn hollers to **their** immediate parent...all the way up to the HTML Element), we can get the **parent** to do something when it hears from a kid, not the kids themselves.

---

## Playground 02: Implementing Event Delegation

We'll use the same code as before, but it's been stripped down a bit.

https://floobits.com/jpratt-mru/lec-09/file/playground-02/start/index.html

You can also get it here: [lecture notes code examples](/lecture-code-examples/lec-09-playground-02)

1. If I click on Cletus, what will happen?
2. If I mouse over Sally Mae, what will happen?
3. If I enter text in Bobby Bob, what will happen?

Let's push - dare I say "delegate"? - the responsibility for actually doing the cool things on Ma and leave them kids alone.

Let's add the code to make this happen, one handler at a time.

#### first change: Cletus' click

```javascript
// first off, have the querySelector select
// Ma - the parent - not Cletus
// question: what's happening now? why?

// next, add an event parameter to dip() - we're gonna need it

// next, replace `this` with e.target

function dip(e) {
  e.target.classList.remove("press");
  void e.target.offsetWidth;
  e.target.classList.add("press");
}

// what does this accomplish?
// Click Cletus. Hey - it works! We're done, right?
// HA! Click Sally, fool!

// We need to make sure our handler only
// reacts when the _right_ kid is
// hollering. So make one last change:

function dip(e) {
  if (e.target.id == "cletus") {
    e.target.classList.remove("press");
    void e.target.offsetWidth;
    e.target.classList.add("press");
  }
}

// Sweet hominy biscuits! It works! We've designated the task of
// making Cletus jump and down like an idjit from Cletus himself
// to his long-suffering mother. Wonderful!
```

#### second change: Bobby Bob's input

```javascript
// well we've done one, so it follows this will be the same - let's
// see if that's the case:

document.querySelector("#ma").addEventListener("input", shake);

function shake(e) {
  if (e.target.id == "bobby-bob") {
    e.target.classList.remove("jive");
    void e.target.offsetWidth;
    e.target.classList.add("jive");
  }
}

// seems to work!

// let's flex those muscles and move the code into an anonymous
// function instead

document.querySelector("#ma").addEventListener("input", function (e) {
  if (e.target.id == "bobby-bob") {
    e.target.classList.remove("jive");
    void e.target.offsetWidth;
    e.target.classList.add("jive");
  }
});
```

#### final change: Sally Mae's scramblin'

```javascript
// easy, right?

document.querySelector("#ma").addEventListener("mouseenter", shuffle);

// Good Lord, but your optimism is ADORABLE!

// mouseenter doesn't bubble, right? So it's not going to make it
// to Ma - kids keep THAT event to themselves.

// You can get around this by using mouseover, though the behaviour
// is a bit different (look at the docs)

document.querySelector("#ma").addEventListener("mouseover", shuffle);
```

#### Before we leave this playground, need to plant a seed

We were lucky here because all the things we were targeting had ids...what if they didn't?....

## Playground 03: An Illustration of Memory Bustitude

One problem that event delegation can solve is that of excessive memory use.

Here's another sample web page (Ma is back with some new kids - a whole BUNCH of 'em):

https://floobits.com/jpratt-mru/lec-09/file/playground-03/before/index.html

You can also get it here: [lecture notes code examples](/lecture-code-examples/lec-09-playground-03)

#### take a look at the code

Let's look at the starting code a bit to get our bearings:

- there's a `data.js` file that contains a big old string in JSON format
- in the `index.html`, notice how we're loading `data.js` before `index.js`. What does this allow us to do?
- in the `index.js`, the first thing we do is turn the JSON into an array of JavaScript objects via `JSON.parse`.
  - it's in the global scope so we can look at it in the console - it should really be in the anonymous handler for DOMContentLoaded.
- then we grab Ma and loop through all the objects in NAMES, using a helper function to add a bunch of divs as Ma's children
  - notice how each div has some text added to it from the object being passed in, and a class for some styling, ... and an event handler
  - these kind of helpers are very useful for assignment 1, btw

#### take it out for a spin

If we open the page in Live Server and click on things, we see everything is working as expected.

_Note from JP: I did *not* choose these names - I got them from http://names.drycodes.com/ so don't blame me for the "Urine", "Poop", and "Hnads")_

Unfortunately, there is trouble a-brewing.

#### pop the hood

_I'm not going to ask you to use Chrome in the following way on a test or anything. This is just a little detour into interesting territory._

If we go to the Memory section of the Chrome dev tools, we can see some cool stuff.

- there are 1002 event listeners out there (where do you suppose this number comes from?)
- the shallow size is how much memory just the handlers use; the retained size is that plus the memory that those handlers are referencing (again, don't worry about the details - this is not that kind of course!)
- if we start hitting the dropdowns, we can see where in the code these things live

#### fixing the problem

```javascript
// so we need to delegate the responsibility for making the kids
// get all shaky-freaky to Ma.

// so let's try that right after we've grabbed Ma

const ma = document.querySelector("#ma");

// yes, this could be a reference to a function declaration
// or an arrow function
ma.addEventListener("click", function(e) {
  if (e.target)  // hmmm....we need to see if it's a kid...how?
});

// you tell me

// eventually will want to wind up here
ma.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
    if (e.target.matches("#ma > div")) {  // not in IE, though
      e.target.classList.toggle("tagged");
      e.target.classList.toggle("jive");
    }
  });
```

If we pop the Memory hood again - hey! That's MUCHO BETTER.

## Playground 04: Kids, They Come and They Go

While the memory problem is really only something you bump into when you're dealing with lots of handlers (which might be pretty uncommon), this next bit is something that you bump into _much_ more frequently. It even occurs on the assignment.

Here's some starting code - it's a very stripped-down version of Playground 03:

https://floobits.com/jpratt-mru/lec-09/file/playground-04/before/index.html

You can also get it here: [lecture notes code examples](/lecture-code-examples/lec-09-playground-04)

#### things to note

We're only adding one kid, so why bother having a helper method, right?

Also, the event handler is being added to the child later in the code. Now it might seem obvious at this moment that this might be a Bad Idea - but it's pretty common when you're first starting out. You're coding along, adding stuff to the DOM, then find out you need to have those things react to an event...so you register those things for an event - wherever. Ruh roh!

#### adding extra functionality

Let's add a twist: we'll add a keyboard handler that will add a new kid back into the first position if the letter 'a' is pressed. And we'll add a keyboard handler that will remove all the kids from Ma's domain if the letter 'r' is pressed.

```javascript
// let's put this code in another file to show you it can be done

// step 1: make a new folder called js to tidy things up

// step 2: make a new file called keyboard-handling.js and rename
// index.js to child-click-handling.js and put it in the js
// folder while we're at it.

// step 3: refer to these files in the html

// step 4: add handlers to handle the key presses into keyboard-handling.js

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  document.body.addEventListener("keydown", function (e) {
    let keyPressed = e.key;
    if (keyPressed == "r") {
      document.querySelector("#ma").replaceChildren();
    } else if (keyPressed == "a") {
      const child = document.createElement("div");
      child.textContent = "Ellie Mae";
      child.classList.add("box");
      document.querySelector("#ma").prepend(child);
    }
  });
});

// step 5: test the page:
//   - click on Ellie Mae. She works as expected.
//   - type 'a' a few times. More Ellies! But what if you click on them?
//   - type 'r'. No Ellies!
//   - type 'a'. Ellies...but they don't do that thing any more
```

### forgetting is easy

So it's super-easy to forget to add event listeners to things being dynamically added to your DOM. Especially when you're dealing with a large code base.

### delegation to the rescue!

Remember that bubbling **still happens** when new things get added to the DOM - those new kids holler out I'VE BEEN CLICKED! even if they haven't been told to _handle_ that click.

So if we get Ma to listen to clicks, then she can make this all work out for us:

```javascript
// make changes to child-click-handling.js

// step 1: make Ma register for clicks (and add an e, cause we need it)

ma.addEventListener("click", function (e) {

// step 2: react when Ma gets a click from a child

  ma.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
    if (e.target.nodeName == "DIV") { // works in IE, too
      e.target.classList.toggle("tagged");
      e.target.classList.toggle("jive");
    }
  });

```
