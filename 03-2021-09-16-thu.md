## odds & ends

- [ ] y'all have my sympathies. Things are f'd up. I don't have any insider information, I fear.
- [ ] how the Current Situation affects us (how you get help from me + my sched)
- [ ] I've disabled our tutorial sites and changed where some things are on our lecture BB (see announcement)

## what's ahead?

- tut-01 on Friday, Sept 17
- asg-01 milestone 1 submission on Wednesday, Sept 22

## a brief recap

- JS is
  - object-oriented (similar but different to Java)
  - dynamically typed (what does that mean?)
  - client-side (meaning?)
  - scripting language (though not quite)
- because JS took off rapidly (Web 2.0), it's become a good thing to learn ... but we're stuck with its quirks
- although client-side JS _can_ be placed inline or be embedded, we'll typically use external JS (connected via a `<script src="blahblah.js"></script>` tag in the `<head>`)
  - you should be ready to work with this flow on your machine, ideally having it good to go by the start of lecture
- JS has many similarities to Java (which is very superfine for us):
  - has variables
  - is case-sensitive
  - uses semicolons (kind of)
  - ignores extra whitespace
  - typical naming conventions (camel case) same

## 8.3 Variables & Data Types

Let's actually do some coding and see what kind of things we can figure out about JS's variables.

We did a quick practice at the end of last lecture, but it was rushed. Let's do it again.

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: what value will foo have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
let foo = 32;
foo = true;
foo = "bar";
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check whether your prediction was correct - type foo into your console!
(that's kinda neat, eh? notice how it's greyed out? hmm....)
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: what value will foo have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
var foo = 32;
foo = true;
foo = "bar";
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: what value will foo have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
const foo = 32;
foo = true;
foo = "bar";
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

### var, let, const

- Table 8.1 in the book (p. 361) has a nice summary
- suggest you use let, const...but you need to know var on sight (and be comfortable with its quirks if you intend to work "in industry")
  - we can't talk about `var` properly without talking about functions first, so...hold off
- we'll be talking more about scope issues and these keywords later in the chapter

## 8.3.1 JavaScript Output

### alert and prompt

- we'll start with `alert` and `prompt`for user-interactive output and input...but move away quickly
  - remember: not really JS!
  - these have docs on MDN. You should look there.
  - I'll switch to Live Server because it's annoying to work with these two rascals in Live Preview
    - if you just have Live Preview, it's not a huge deal...but you might get a bit peevish shortly :)

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: what will happen if we do the following?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
alert("How exciting!");
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

### ðŸ›‘ <span style="color:red">STOP</span>

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: What will be in "result" if we run the following and enter "peas" at the prompt?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
const result = prompt("What's round & green?");
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: What will be in "result" if we run the following and hit cancel? Enter nothing? Enter just whitespace? Close the dialog via Esc?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
const result = prompt("What's round & green?");
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Now that I'm done using `alert` and `prompt`, I'll switch back to Live Preview, 'cause I like the faster feedback.**

---

### console

`console.log()` is insanely useful and common

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: What will happen when the following code is run?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
console.log("yo");
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: What will happen when the following code is run?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
console.log("yo", 3);
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<tr>
<td>Predict: What will happen when the following code is run?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
let x = 4;
console.warn(x * 2);

x = 10;
console.error(x * 2);
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

**console.log rocks**

Super-useful way to check your variables and see what's going on in your code. (what do you call these kind of statements?)

Don't get me wrong, the debugger is great - and you should _definitely_ learn how to use it - but damn, you can get through a lot of problems with a simple console.log!

**gotcha**

Notice anything about the line numbers that Live Preview is reporting? How does that differ from Live Server output?

### document.write()

You can use `document.write` to "write" stuff to our HTML document dynamically:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: What will happen when the following code is run?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
document.write("<h1>What dark witchery is this?!?</h1>");
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**gotcha**
Look CAREFULLY at the resulting html in the devtools. Anything seem...off?

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: What will happen when the following code is run?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
let name = prompt("Yer name?");

document.write("Are we having fun yet, " + name + "?");
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**thoughts**

Using `document.write` is actually a pretty bad idea except for when puttering (or for the first few tutorials :) )

- can have unpredictable effects
- can be a security hole
- doesn't get added to the DOM, which severely limits its usefulness (more on this when we hit chapter 9)

## 8.3.2 Data Types

- [Java] we've got primitive types and reference types
- [!Java] we've got primitives, but our primitive list is quite a bit different. From MDN (remember MDN?):

  - Boolean
  - Number
  - String
  - Null (weird)
  - Undefined (weird)
  - BigInt (not in text...don't worry 'bout it)
  - Symbol (advanced...don't worry 'bout it)

- [Java] visualizing memory is useful, especially when references are involved

  - to the ~~Batcave~~ whiteboard!
  - from Fig 8.9 (p 366) in the text

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: What will happen after each line is executed? How can we visualize memory at each step?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
let abc = 27;
abc = 35;

let message = "hello";
message = "bye";

let msg = "hello";
msg = "hello";

let foo = [45, 35, 25];
foo[0] = 123;
foo[0] = "this is ok";

let person = { name: "Randy" };
person.name = "Ricardo";
person = {};
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**so when should I use const?!?**

Two schools of thought:

- use it whenever possible...what's the harm?
- only use it when it's "meant" to be used

> you can SCREAMING_CASE if you want, but...

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: Just run these in the console, because if you're using Live Preview, you get some console pollution. What will you see after you type each line?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
typeof 88;
typeof 132.0;
typeof "monorail!";
typeof true;
typeof undefined;
typeof null;
typeof { name: "Monty" };
typeof [1, 2, 3];
typeof alert;
```

## 8.3.3 Built-In Objects

- [Java] just like all the built-in stuff available in the Java API (ArrayList, Collection, Date, TreeMap, etc.), JS has built-in stuff as well.
  - Go take a look. Where? (Do I have to say it? :) )
    - You can actually use "built-in objects" in your search
  - Play around with some of them. Especially `Number`, which is among the skills checked tomorrow....

#### 8.3.4 Concatenation [tut-01 cutoff topic]

- pick a style and be consistent (or follow your shop's rules)
- just because you **can** use ` all the time doesn't mean you should - it has a meaning and sends a signal to readers; don't mess with their heads

- hitting conditionals and such might be a good opp to talk about Front End Masters courses and their availability via GitHub student pack. Also Execute Program?

- [ ] coercion

  - [ ] WAT video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3se2-thqf-A)

- why is it "undefined" and not "uninitialized"?!?!?

## questions from y'all during the lecture

### anonymous qs

### Meet qs

## suggestions for success

So what's upcoming in the near future?

- tut-01 on Friday, Sept 17
- the asg-01 milestone 1 submission on Wednesday, Sept 22

Based on these, if I were taking this course, I'd work to:

- make sure I'm super-comfortable cloning a tutorial onto my machine. Ideally, I wanna do that without having to think too much or fumble around...the second the GitHub Classroom link goes live, I wanna have the repo on my machine and start reading the instructions within 60 seconds. If I wasn't at that point, I'd practice until I _was_ at that point.

- read the [preview for tut-01](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-3512-202104-001/tutorial-previews/blob/main/tut-01.md), make sure I've done its prerequisites (especially the suggested lab exercises), and make sure I feel comfortable with all the skills mentioned.

- be well into the suggestions mentioned in the "assignment nudge" announcement on Blackboard made on September 12.
