**!!! Start Recording, JP !!!**

## odds & ends

- [ ] y'all have my sympathies. Things are f'd up. I don't have any insider information, I fear.
- [ ] how the Current Situation affects us (how you get help from me + my sched)
- [ ] I've disabled our tutorial sites and changed where some things are on our lecture BB (see announcement)

## something on your mind?

**Any questions right now?**

## what's ahead?

- tut-01 on Friday, Sept 17
- asg-01 milestone 1 submission on Wednesday, Sept 22

## a brief recap

- JS is
  - object-oriented (similar but different to Java)
  - dynamically typed (what does that mean?)
  - client-side (meaning?)
  - scripting language (though not quite)
- because JS took off rapidly (Web 2.0), it's become a good thing to learn ... but we're stuck with its quirks
- although client-side JS _can_ be placed inline or be embedded, we'll typically use external JS (connected via a `<script src="blahblah.js"></script>` tag in the `<head>`)
  - you should be ready to work with this flow on your machine, ideally having it good to go by the start of lecture
- JS has many similarities to Java (which is very superfine for us):
  - has variables
  - is case-sensitive
  - uses semicolons (kind of)
  - ignores extra whitespace
  - typical naming conventions (camel case) same

## 8.3 Variables & Data Types

Let's actually do some coding and see what kind of things we can figure out about JS's variables.

We did a quick practice at the end of last lecture, but it was rushed. Let's do it again.

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: what value will foo have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
let foo = 32;
foo = true;
foo = "bar";
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check whether your prediction was correct - type foo into your console!
(that's kinda neat, eh? notice how it's greyed out? hmm....)
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: what value will foo have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
var foo = 32;
foo = true;
foo = "bar";
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: what value will foo have?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
const foo = 32;
foo = true;
foo = "bar";
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>

### var, let, const

- Table 8.1 in the book (p. 361) has a nice summary
- suggest you use let, const...but you need to know var on sight (and be comfortable with its quirks if you intend to work "in industry")
  - we can't talk about `var` properly without talking about functions first, so...hold off
- we'll be talking more about scope issues and these keywords later in the chapter

## 8.3.1 JavaScript Output

### alert and prompt

- we'll start with `alert` and `prompt`for user-interactive output and input...but move away quickly
  - remember: not really JS!
  - these have docs on MDN. You should look there.
  - I'll switch to Live Server because it's annoying to work with these two rascals in Live Preview
    - if you just have Live Preview, it's not a huge deal...but you might get a bit peevish shortly :)

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: what will happen if we do the following?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
alert("How exciting!");
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
const result = prompt("What's round & green?");
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: What will be in "result" if we run the following and hit cancel? Enter nothing? Enter just whitespace? Close the dialog via Esc?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
const result = prompt("What's round & green?");
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Now that I'm done using `alert` and `prompt`, I'll switch back to Live Preview, 'cause I like the faster feedback.**

> _after-the-fact comment: crap...I forgot that Live Preview puts wacky pollution in the console when you log!_

---

### console

`console.log()` is insanely useful and common

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: What will happen when the following code is run?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
console.log("yo");
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: What will happen when the following code is run?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
console.log("yo", 3);
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

x = 10;
console.error(x * 2);
```

</td>

**console.log rocks**

Super-useful way to check your variables and see what's going on in your code. (what do you call these kind of statements?)

Don't get me wrong, the debugger is great - and you should _definitely_ learn how to use it - but damn, you can get through a lot of problems with a simple console.log!

**gotcha**

Notice anything about the line numbers that Live Preview is reporting? How does that differ from Live Server output?

### document.write()

You can use `document.write` to "write" stuff to our HTML document dynamically:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: What will happen when the following code is run?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
document.write("<h1>What dark witchery is this?!?</h1>");
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**gotcha**
Look CAREFULLY at the resulting html in the devtools. Anything seem...off?

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: What will happen when the following code is run?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
let name = prompt("Yer name?");

document.write("Are we having fun yet, " + name + "?");
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**thoughts**

Using `document.write` is actually a pretty bad idea except for when puttering (or for the first few tutorials :) )

- can have unpredictable effects
- can be a security hole
- doesn't get added to the DOM, which severely limits its usefulness (more on this when we hit chapter 9)

## 8.3.2 Data Types

- [Java] we've got primitive types and reference types
- [!Java] we've got primitives, but our primitive list is quite a bit different. From MDN (remember MDN?):

  - Boolean
  - Number
  - String
  - Null (weird)
  - Undefined (weird)
  - BigInt (not in text...don't worry 'bout it)
  - Symbol (advanced...don't worry 'bout it)

- [Java] visualizing memory is useful, especially when references are involved

  - to the ~~Batcave~~ whiteboard!
  - from Fig 8.9 (p 366) in the text

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: What will happen after each line is executed? How can we visualize memory at each step?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
let abc = 27;
abc = 35;

let message = "hello";
message = "bye";

let msg = "hello";
msg = "hello";

let foo = [45, 35, 25];
foo[0] = 123;
foo[0] = "this is ok";

let person = { name: "Randy" };
person.name = "Ricardo";
person = {};
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
check
</td>
</tr>
</table>

# We got this far in lecture today

const abc = 27;
abc = 35;

const message = "hello";

const msg = "hello";

const foo = [45, 35, 25];
foo[0] = 123;
foo[0] = "this is ok";

const person = { name: "Randy" };
person.name = "Ricardo";
person = {};
```

**so when should I use const?!?**

Two schools of thought:

- use it whenever possible...what's the harm?
- only use it when it's "meant" to be used

> you can SCREAMING_CASE if you want, but...

<table>
<tr>
<td>Predict: Just run these in the console, because if you're using Live Preview, you get some console pollution. What will you see after you type each line?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```javascript
typeof 88;
typeof 132.0;
typeof "monorail!";
typeof true;
typeof undefined;
typeof null;
typeof { name: "Monty" };
typeof [1, 2, 3];
typeof alert;
```

## 8.3.3 Built-In Objects

- [Java] just like all the built-in stuff available in the Java API (ArrayList, Collection, Date, TreeMap, etc.), JS has built-in stuff as well.
  - Go take a look. Where? (Do I have to say it? :) )
    - You can actually use "built-in objects" in your search
  - Play around with some of them. Especially `Number`, which is among the skills checked tomorrow....

#### 8.3.4 Concatenation [tut-01 cutoff topic]

- pick a style and be consistent (or follow your shop's rules)
- just because you **can** use ` all the time doesn't mean you should - it has a meaning and sends a signal to readers; don't mess with their heads

**HERE ENDETH THE LESSON**

## questions from y'all during the lecture

### anonymous qs

1. What's this about the textbook only being a rental?
   - _Yeah...it's come up before recently. Not happy about this. Still seeing if Randy has any inside skinny._
2. So are we supposed to finish tutorials during class time on Friday's?
   - _Ideally, yes...but you have until 9 or 10 PM to submit your work. (Remember, though, you still have to show me one or two completed exercises once we're about 20 minutes into the tut.)_
3. What do we with the tutorial previews?
   - _Look at them before the tuts come around so that you're ready to roll when the tuts roll around._
4. How do we show that we completed all the exercises at 9 pm?
   - _The GitHub knows all._
5. We can use the second edition right JP?
   - _Don't make me come over there._
6. What if we just put a picture of the book on a random book and show it to you?
   - _That wouldn't be very sporting, would it?_
7. Even though JS knows to make foo = 32 as a constant, it still throws an error when you try to change the assignment. Why?
   - _I'm afraid I don't follow...but the question intrigues me._
8. Do you think that MRU will move in person classes to online due to covid work from home?
   - _Any attempt at prediction at this point is meaningless. I'm personally in "sit back and watch the show unfold" mode._
9. Does JS have a \"null\"?
   - _Now why would it have something crazy like...oh wait. Yeah. It has a null._
10. JP why do people use React and node.js?

    - _That sounds like a question for Web 3!_

11. Isn't live preview the same as live server?

    - _In the same way that red apples and green apples are apples, yes._

12. What's the difference between Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Visual Studio?

    - _One is a complex, (sometimes) expensive, resource-use-intensive, IDE. The other is a lightweight (though extensible), free, text editor. I'll let you decide which is which!_

13. What if you used a UTF-char [in a prompt], since javascript vars can be anything - would it work?

    - _Give it a try and report back._

14. Do we use github for our lab submissions or do we use blackboard for submissions?

    - _GitHub for the win._

15. How do we schedule an office time with you?

    - _Look at my schedule, then look at your schedule. Find a happy time. Then ask me via email!_

16. What's a typescript? sounds like JavaScript so...they siblings??

    - _Well "a typescript" and "TypeScript" are two different beasts. I suspect you mean the latter. The [TypeScript home page](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) says "TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types." Seems a better definition than my rambling in-lecture one._

17. '5' + x - x = ?
    - Behave.
18. These different console outputs [log, error, warn, info] exist as a way to throw different types of responses?
    - _That's not a bad way to say it. I like it._
19. Does foo refer to the first element in the array or all of them?

    - _If you have `let foo = [1,2,3]`, foo refers to the first element in the array._

20. What if you change a value in bar. Would it make a copy of the array?

    - _If foo and bar both refer to the same array (as we have in an example above), then no copy is made. Changing bar is the same as changing foo, since they both refer to the same object in memory._

### Meet qs

1. What's the difference between var and let?
   - _We'll get into this more after we talk about functions. And scope in JS._
2. We should use let instead of var?
   - _As a general rule of thumb? Current opinion seems to lean this way. I am but a reed in the wind of opinion._
3. Will you only check the latest version of our push to github?
   - _Almost - I'll check the latest version **submitted on time**._
4. Can you declare the array to be in integer or string format?
   - _JS is dynamically typed, so...._
5. Is embedded javascript block in html same as `<script> </script>`?

   - _Correctamundo._

6. Now can you look at the picture in discord?
   - _No. Oh fine, ok....(looks)...that **is** somewhat clever._

## suggestions for success

So what's upcoming in the near future?

- tut-01 on Friday, Sept 17
- the asg-01 milestone 1 submission on Wednesday, Sept 22

Based on these, if I were taking this course, I'd work to:

- make sure I'm super-comfortable cloning a tutorial onto my machine. Ideally, I wanna do that without having to think too much or fumble around...the second the GitHub Classroom link goes live, I wanna have the repo on my machine and start reading the instructions within 60 seconds. If I wasn't at that point, I'd practice until I _was_ at that point.

- read the [preview for tut-01](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-3512-202104-001/tutorial-previews/blob/main/tut-01.md), make sure I've done its prerequisites (especially the suggested lab exercises), and make sure I feel comfortable with all the skills mentioned.

- be well into the suggestions mentioned in the "assignment nudge" announcement on Blackboard made on September 12.
