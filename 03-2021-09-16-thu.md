So what's upcoming in the near future?

- tut-01 on Friday, Sept 17
- the asg-01 milestone 1 submission on Wednesday, Sept 22

Based on these, if I were taking this course, I'd work to:

- make sure I'm super-comfortable cloning a tutorial onto my machine. Ideally, I wanna do that without having to think too much or fumble around...the second the GitHub Classroom link goes live, I wanna have the repo on my machine and start reading the instructions within 60 seconds. If I wasn't at that point, I'd practice until I _was_ at that point.

- read the [preview for tut-01](https://github.com/MRU-CSIS-3512-202104-001/tutorial-previews/blob/main/tut-01.md), make sure I've done its prerequisites (especially the suggested lab exercises), and make sure I feel comfortable with all the skills mentioned.

- be well into the suggestions mentioned in the "assignment nudge" announcement on Blackboard made on September 12.
